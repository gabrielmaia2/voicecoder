Abstract
Clustering schemes offer a practical way of providing scalability when dealing with large and dense Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). The feasibility of a clustering method can be primarily determined by the complexity of the cluster head selection. Optimizing the cluster head selection allows for the network to be more efficient by minimizing the signaling overhead while ensuring that the network connectivity is maintained despite topology changes. In this paper, we investigate the problems of cluster head selection for large and dense MANETs. Two variants of the cluster head selection are examined: (1) the distance-constrained selection where every node in the network must be located within a certain distance to the nearest cluster head; and (2) the size-constrained selection where each cluster is only allowed to have a limited number of members. We show that the problem of minimizing the set of cluster heads is NP-hard for both variants. We propose two distributed selection algorithms, each having logarithmic approximation ratio, for these variants. We also discuss, using simulations, the resulting cluster size distribution and cluster head density, which impact the efficient operation of the network.
Keywords: MANET, scalability, clustering algorithms,
complexity, NP-complete.
1. Introduction
In the near future, the US military's Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) [1] is expected to create radios that work together to form autonomous ad hoc networks. Also, the US DARPA's Wireless Network after Next program (WNaN) [2, 3] aims at developing technologies and concepts enabling the deployment of massively dense networks. The technology created by the WNaN program is expected to provide reliable and highly-available battlefield communication systems at low operating cost. As a result, there will be challenges for routing protocols to support distributed and adaptive network operations in these large, dense and scalable MANETs.

Out of many existing MANET routing protocols, OLSR [4] is being considered as a very potential candidate for IETF standardization and for military networking deployment. OLSR is a proactive protocol, which means the node knowledge about the network topology is periodically refreshed.
When the size of the network grows, the amount of signaling overhead also increases to maintain the topology updates. One of the main issues of a MANET's routing protocol is hence its capacity to scale on large and dense networks. The two most popular techniques to reduce signaling overhead in MANETs are Fish Eye [5, 6] and clustering [7].
With the Fish Eye technique, the frequency of topology updates is inversely proportional to the distance to the updating source. Instead of sending signaling messages to distant nodes at the same rate as to nearby nodes, Fish Eye modifies the routing protocols such that these messages are only forwarded at a lower rate beyond some distance thresholds. A strong advantage of the Fish Eye technique is that the routing protocols can easily be modified to enable Fish Eye capability in practical implementation. Also, Fish Eye routers do not need extra network interfaces to relay information as compared to cluster heads' requirement in some cluster-based techniques. However, the Fish Eye technique still keeps a flat network architecture. Thus, every node still relays signaling messages for every other node, less frequently though.
In cluster-based routing, the network is divided into clusters. Each cluster has a cluster head (CH) node and some ordinary member nodes. MANET routing protocols are run in each cluster and their signaling messages are to propagate only within the cluster. The CHs notify each other about their cluster's members frequently using a different communication channel. Inter-cluster communications are relayed by CHs. The CHs may in turn

form another MANET and be clusterized to an upper level if needed.
In order to reduce the overhead of the CH communications, the number of clusters must be minimized in the whole network. The CHs are thus spaced out to cover all nodes of the network and this also improves the spatial reuse of CH intra-communications. Therefore, most cluster-based techniques form nonoverlapping clusters where CHs have multiple network interfaces with different communication ranges (e.g.: short range for intra-cluster and long-range for inter-cluster communications.) Notice that cluster-based technique can also be applied to MANETs where the nodes only have single network interface. In this situation, the intercommunication between distant CHs takes place as pointto-point communications. The traffic is then relayed by ordinary, intermediate nodes sitting between these CHs. While the network's communication performance can be different depending on the number of wireless interfaces each node has, the problem of CH selection is fundamentally unchanged.
Compared to the flat network architecture inherent to the Fish Eye technique, the hierarchical structure of cluster-based routing is more suitable for a well-defined, multilevel tactical military network. In practice, the Hierarchical OLSR protocol (HOLSR [8]) has implemented a cluster-based routing mechanism for tactical MANETs. Figure 1(a) illustrates a combat unit in a tactical MANET. The combat unit includes a vehicle and the ground troops assigned to it. Communications between troops of different units are relayed by their vehicles. Each vehicle has two radio interfaces: short- and long-range. The short-range interface allows the vehicle to communicate with neighboring vehicles, with distances from hundreds meters to one kilometer. The long-range interface allows for communication with other vehicles farther than several kilometers. Each combat unit is represented by a node of the graph in Figure 1(b). The short-range radio interface allows units to form a multihop MANET.
With cluster-based routing, three CHs are selected among the nodes in Figure 1(b). Each CH covers a cluster encompassing its direct neighbors. The CHs then communicate with each other using the long-range interfaces. Therefore, they may form another multihop MANET. The communications between nodes from different clusters are relayed by CHs.
The CH selection is static in the current implementation of HOLSR. The CHs are chosen before the network's deployment. They broadcast messages inviting other nodes to join their clusters as a function of the nodes' distance to the nearest CH. No new CH is selected during the network's operation. This static

selection may lead to problems of CHs' availability due to node mobility or due to CHs' failure.

In this paper we investigate the selection of CHs in a distributed environment such as MANET. We derive new results on the complexity and efficiency of two variants of the CH selection: distance-constrained and sizeconstrained clustering. The analysis of our simulations allows for the recognition of some properties that are most relevant to the overhead and the performance of these networks.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We present in Section 2 some existing work on CH selection in MANETs. The complexity of CH selection is investigated in detail in Section 3. We also present distributed algorithms to select CHs in MANETs. We analyze in Section 4 some properties of these algorithms, obtained by simulations, that are most relevant to the overhead and the efficiency of the network. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 5.
2. Related Work
CH selection has extensively been studied in the literature of wireless ad hoc networks. It was showed in [9, 10] that using clusters for data-aggregation in large-scale sensor networks can significantly improve the sensors' lifetime. In [9], Heinzelman et al propose a protocol (LEACH) that allows nodes to select CHs using a distributed algorithm. Each sensor takes its turn as CH so that their energy consumption is balanced. LEACH ensures that the network has on average a fixed, predefined number of CHs at any time. Chen et al [10] improve this approach by first estimating the optimal number of clusters to

efficiently utilize data correlation of sensors. A new random CH selection algorithm is then proposed, aiming at minimizing the distance between the CHs and their members.
Koshy et al [11] show that information entropy (used by the authors as a way to classify nodes as conservative or exploratory based on their activities) can also serve as a metric to form clusters. Nodes with low level of activities are more likely to become CHs. This method may therefore produce stable CHs.
In [12], Xia et al propose a distributed CH selection protocol that forms clusters of nodes having similar sensed data in order to optimize the data aggregation at the CHs. Their protocol also considers including into the cluster the
nodes located at any distance up to h -hops away from the
CH. Thus, their work is closely related to our distanceconstrained CH selection with an additional constraint on the node's data similarity.
Regarding MANETs, Chinara et al report in [7] an interesting survey on clustering algorithms, ranging from nodes' ID-based selection to mobility and connectivity metric-based selection. They show that while ID-based selection produces a fast and stable cluster setup, it suffers from the rigidness of the CHs' structure, because the same nodes are often selected independently of the network topology. Topology-dependent CH selection (based on mobility and connectivity metrics) can produce a more evenly distributed CH set. However, they may require a larger cluster setup time. An example of clustering based on mobility consideration is given in [13] by Konstantopoulos et al.
We choose to consider the CH selection in this paper uniquely with the constraints related to the network topology graph, i.e. limiting the distance (in number of hops) between each CH and its members or limiting the size of each cluster. The reason behind those limitations is because other metrics (e.g.: energy, traffic load, mobility factors) can often be modeled using an appropriate weighted graph topology. For example: energy-saving CH selection in a network can be modeled by a CH selection in a weighted graph (the weight of each node is inversely proportional to its remaining energy amount) in which the sum of all CHs' weight is minimized. More generally, in graph theory, CH selection is studied with the dominating set problems [14].
Out of the two variants of CH selection that we present in this paper, the distance-constrained CH selection is cited as a known variant of the dominating set problem in [14]. Amis et al present in [15] a proof showing the NPcompleteness of this variant. The authors also propose a heuristic to select CHs based on the nodes' ID. However, this heuristic is known to fail to provide a good solution in some pathological cases, for example: when the nodes' ID are monotonically increasing or decreasing in a straight

line. Also, the efficiency of the proposed heuristic, represented by the approximation factor of its result compared to an optimal solution, has not been investigated.
The second variant that we examine in this paper, the size-constrained CH selection, is more related to the work done by Nam et al [16] where the CH selection tries to form clusters of equal size. Chatterjee et al [17] also propose a distributed clustering algorithm that takes into consideration various parameters such as ideal degree, transmission power, mobility, etc., while limiting the number of members in each cluster.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no known result on the complexity of the size-constrained CH selection. Also, the existing work done on CH selection does not investigate the approximation factor of the proposed solutions for both problems that we examine.
We present in this paper a proof showing the NPcompleteness of the size-constrained CH selection. A new proof, which is significantly shorter than the one in [15], is also presented for the distance-constrained CH selection problem. Moreover, we propose a distributed algorithm for each problem and show that they can achieve logarithmic approximation factors, which is known (see Feige [19]) to be best possible unless NP has superpolynomial time algorithms.
Notice that other variants of CH selection exist. For example, Kuhn et al [18] propose two algorithms of CH selection such that each node is a member of no less than
k different clusters to ensure fault tolerance. The study of
these variants is beyond the scope of this paper because we are primarily concerned with the minimization of the number of CHs in the whole network. However, we acknowledge in our analysis that the number of clusters that encompass a node is a factor reflecting the robustness of the clustering scheme.
Given the ad hoc nature of MANET routers and their low computational capacity, it is thus important that we investigate the complexity of these CH selection variants and propose distributed algorithms that can be applied to a tactical MANET environment.
3. Cluster Head Selection
We study in this section two variants of the CH selection for MANETs. The first variant selects CHs such that every
dependant node is within a distance h hops from the
nearest CH. The second variant selects CHs such that the
size of each cluster is not larger than  . We will discuss
the complexity of both problems and derive distributed CH selection algorithms that are applicable to MANETs.
In addition, a third variant, called distance-and-sizeconstrained CH selection, which is a combination of the two variants described above, is also examined.

3.1 Distance-constrained CH Selection
In this section we consider the selection of CHs in a
MANET of n nodes such that every node in this network is within distance h hops of a CH, for a given positive h .
Such a set of CHs is said to cover within h hops the whole network. It is natural to seek the minimum set of CHs to reduce the communication overhead between CHs.
To start, we state a result on the NP-completeness of the decision problem of finding such a set of size no larger
than k CHs. Then, we present a greedy distributed
algorithm allowing to select the CHs with an
approximation factor of min(ln h , ln n) , where  is
the maximum degree of the topology graph.
3.1.1 Complexity
Let G = (V , E) be a graph representing the network topology, | V |= n . Each vertex v V represents a node and for all vertices u, v V , (u, v)  E if and only if two nodes u and v are direct neighbors. Let h be a
positive number, the minimum CH set of the MANET is
then represented by the minimum set of vertices S  V such that for every vertex u , either u  S or there exists a vertex v  S such that d (u, v)„ h . d (u, v) denotes the shortest distance between nodes u and v in terms of hop. Such a set S is called distance- h dominating set of G (cf. [14]).
Notice that if h = 1 then the problem of finding such a minimum set S is identical to the minimum dominating
set problem, which is equivalent to the NP-hard minimum set cover in [20].
We examine the decision problem of the distance- h dominating set, defined as follows. Let k < n positive, does the network admit a set of CHs of size at most k such that each node is either a CH or is within distance h
hops away from a CH? One can see that such a set exists if
and only if G admits a distance- h dominating set of size at most k .
Theorem 1: The decision problem of the distance- h
dominating set is NP-complete.
Proof: It is easy to verify that this problem is in NP. Given
a set S , | S | „ k , it can be checked in polynomial time that every vertex of G is either in S or within distance h to a vertex in S by calculating the shortest path from all vertices in S to all vertices in V \ S .

To prove NP-completeness, we use induction on h by reducing the problem distance- (h 1) dominating set to

the problem distance- h dominating set. Notice that this

problem is known to be NP-complete when h = 1. Let G = (V , E) be a graph. We construct a new

graph G by extending G in the following manner: for each v V , we add a new vertex v and an edge connecting v and v . Formally, G = (V , E) where

V  = V {v | v V}

and

E = E {(v, v) | v V } . This construction is

polynomial time. Our goal is to show that G has a distance- (h 1) dominating set of size at most k if and

only if G has a distance- h dominating set of size at most k .
Let S be a distance- (h 1) dominating set of G of

size k . It is clear that S is also a distance- h dominating set of G . Because for each vertex v V  \ S , if v V then there is s  S such that d (s, v)„ h 1 < h by the

definition of S . If v V  \ V then v is connected to a

vertex v* V . Again, there exists s  S such that d (s, v*)„ h 1 in G leading to d (s, v)„ h in G .

Now, let us assume that S is a distance- h

dominating set of G of size k . We construct a set S

from

vertices from V . For each v V \ S let s  S such that d (s, v) is minimum. It is impossible that d (s, v)…h in

G since it would imply d (s, v)…h 1 with v the

extended vertex of v in G and for all s  S , a contradiction of the definition of S . Therefore, S is a distance- (h 1) dominating set of G of size at most k .

3.1.2 Greedy distributed algorithm for CH selection
There are many centralized algorithms to approximate the minimum dominating set (cf. [21, 22, 23]). However, it is known by Feige [19] that the minimum dominating set
cannot be approximated within a ratio of (1  ) ln n , for any  > 0 , unless NP has nO (loglogn) time algorithms.
Therefore, known polynomial time approximation algorithms for this problem, which produce an
approximation factor of ln n , are essentially best

possible. If the maximum degree of the network graph is
 , then an approximation factor of ln  can be achieved. For a given positive h , we design a greedy,
distributed algorithm appoximating the minimum
dominating set for the selection of a distance- h dominating set. Let v be a node, the distance- h neighborhood of v , denoted as Nh (v) , contains all nodes within h hops from v . The distance- h degree of node v is dh (v) =| Nh (v) | . Let Wh (v) be the set of
uncovered nodes in Nh (v) and wh (v) =| Wh (v) | . We assume there exists a distance- h neighborhood discovery protocol that allows each node v to know Nh (v) , Wh (v) and wh (u) for all u  Nh (v) . Typically, for h = 2 , the NHDP protocol for MANETs by Clausen et al
[24] can easily be adapted to satisfy this requirement.
Each node v executes the following greedy algorithm to select the CHs according to the distance- h constraint:
Algorithm
1. While v is still uncovered: 2. If there is u Wh (v) , u  v , such that wh (u) = max(wh (z) | z Wh (v)) then send a
message to Wh (v) declaring the wish to select u as
CH. In case of a tie, then choose the node having the largest ID.
3. If all nodes in Wh (v) select v as CH, then v
sends a message to Wh (v) to announce it is becoming a CH. v is marked as covered. 4. If v has sent a message to select u as CH and has received a message from u announcing that it becomes a CH then v is marked as covered.
5. end while.
In this greedy algorithm, at least one CH is selected after each round of its execution. To see that this is true: it is true for the first execution round in which there is at
least one node u selected by all its h -hop neighbors (at least the node u with the largest wh (u) in the whole network will be selected.) Node u then forms its cluster
and this cluster is removed from the topology graph because the cluster's nodes are marked as covered. The algorithm is re-executed with this new topology graph.
Therefore, the time complexity of the CH selection is at most linear in the size of the network. We also know the approximation factor achievable by this algorithm based on a similar result on the greedy set-covering algorithm in

[21] (see also Chvátal [22]), to which the interested reader may refer for full details.

Theorem 2: This greedy algorithm yields a dominating
set of size of O (| S* | min(ln h , ln n)) , where S* is
the minimum distance- h dominating set for the given
instance.

Proof: It is known from [21] that the greedy algorithm for
the dominating set problem can achieve an H -

approximation. Hi is the i th harmonic number. If we
expand the notion of neighborhood to consider all
neighbors within h hops, then the approximation factor becomes H[h] where [h] = maxvV (| Nh (v) |)„ n .

3.2 Size-constrained CH Selection

There is a major drawback with the previous selection of a CH set. Because this mode of selection is based solely on the distance constraint, it offers no control over the size of each cluster. If some clusters are too large and the CHs have to relay a high amount of control traffic for their dependants then congestions may occur in the network. It can directly impact the network's quality of service.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of the cluster size for a
network of n = 100 nodes with node density  = 20 .
This distribution is obtained by averaging the simulation results of 20000 random network scenarios. The CHs are selected according to the distance-2 constraint, i.e. each
node is either a CH or is within 2 hops from a CH. The x axis depicts the size of clusters and the y -axis the
percentage of nodes being in a cluster of that size. This percentage is calculated over 100 nodes and over 20000 random scenarios that we simulated. We can observe that the cluster size's distribution is highly uneven: 62% of nodes in the network are in clusters that have more than 60 dependants, whereas 29% of nodes are in clusters that only have 20 dependants or less. With the majority of nodes being dependants of large clusters, the network traffic can be congested due to the bottlenecks at the CHs.

Therefore, we consider a second method of CH selection for MANETs, called size-constrained CH selection. Each CH is only allowed to include a maximum
number  of nodes in its cluster. If some nodes in its
neighborhood are still uncovered, then a new CH must be
selected to cover them. We call this problem size- 
dominating set. Our goal is to seek a minimum set of CHs to reduce the
overhead between them. Similar to the distance- h
dominating set problem, we find that the decision problem
for the size- dominating set is also NP-complete for a general graph and …2 . We then present a distributed
algorithm to select a small set of CHs with size constraint
.
3.2.1 Complexity

To show that it is NP-complete, we reduce a general instance of the minimum dominating set problem to our problem. Notice that we only need to prove NP-
completeness for all graphs having  =    , for any fixed …1 .
Let G0 = (V0 , E0 ) be a graph with maximum degree 0„  . We construct a graph G from G0 as follows. First, we create (  0  ) copies of G0 , denoted as Gi = (Vi , Ei ) for i = 1..(  0  ) . Each Gi is isomorphic to G0 . Let v0 V0 be a node having maximum degree in G0 (i.e. d (v0 ) = 0 ) and vi Vi be the copy of v0 in Gi . We obtain G by connecting all vi together, for i = 0..(  0  ) . This construction is polynomial time. Figure 3 shows the construction of G from an example of G0 .
Fig. 3. Construction of the graph G from G0 with  = 4 and  = 1.

The decision problem of the size-  dominating set is defined as follows. Let k < n positive, can the network be partitioned into at most k clusters, each CH has no more than  dependants and is at distance 1-hop from its
dependants? It is trivial that such a partition exists if and only if the network graph can be partitioned into at most
k subgraphs, each isomorphic to a star of degree at most .
Notice that if  = 1 then the set of clusters becomes a
maximum matching of the graph, which implies the problem can be solved in polynomial time using Edmonds'
algorithm [25] for any graph. On the other hand, if … ,
then it is equivalent to the classical NP-hard minimum dominating set problem.
Theorem 3: The decision problem of size- dominating set is NP-complete for all …2 .
Proof: This problem is clearly in NP since it can be verified in polynomial time that each subgraph in a set of
k subgraphs is isomorphic to a star of degree at most  .

By the construction of G , its maximum degree is

 = dG (vi ) =    . Our goal is to show that G0

admits a dominating set of size at most k if and only if

G admits a size-  dominating set of size at most

k(  0   1) .

Let S0  V0 be a dominating set in G0 of size k . Let

Si  Vi be the copy of S0 in graph Gi . It is trivial that

Because

each

is also a size-  dominating set of G . We also have

We assume now that G admits a size- dominating

set of size k(  0   1) , denoted as S . Let

Si = S Vi . Because Vi and Vj are disjoint for all

Two cases are possible:

1. i,| Si |= k . If v0  S0 then after removing the

edges connecting v0 to vi Vi , we obtain the graph G0

with a dominating set S0 of size k . Otherwise, if there is

j such that v j  S j then we can obtain by the same

process a graph G j isomorphic to G0 with a dominating

set S j . Now, if i, vi  Si then by the construction of

G every vi is covered by a vertex ui  Si  Vi (i.e.

none of the vi is covered by another v j .) This means

removing the edges connecting all vi together does not

change the coverage in G . Hence, S0 is a dominating set

in G0 . 2. i {0,,  0  } , such that | Si |< k . It is

straightforward in this case that Si {vi} is a dominating

set in Gi isomorphic to G0 , of size at most k .

3.2.2 Greedy distributed algorithm for CH selection

Similarly to the selection of CHs based on the distance constraint, we design a greedy, distributed polynomial time algorithm for our problem of size-constrained CH selection.
We use the same notations as with the distance-
constrained CH selection. In particular, N (v) denotes the
1-hop neighborhood of v and W (v)  N (v) is the set
of v 's uncovered neighbors. Let w(v) =| W (v) | . We
assume there is a neighborhood discovery protocol that
allows each node v to know N (v) , W (v) and w(u)
for all u  N (v) . This algorithm is executed by v until v is covered,
i.e. v becomes a CH or a CH's dependant.

Algorithm
1. While v is still uncovered: 2. If there exists u W (v) , u  v , such that w(u) = max(w(z) | z W (v)) then send a
message to W (v) declaring the wish to select u as
CH. In case of a tie, then choose the node having the largest ID.
3. If all nodes in W (v) wish to select v as CH, then
v sends a message to W (v) to announce it is

becoming a CH. This messsage contains a list of at
most  neighbors that v has chosen to include into its cluster. These neighbors u are chosen according
to the increasing order of their w(u) . v is marked
as covered.
4. If v has sent a message to select u as CH and has received a message from u announcing that it becomes a CH with v in the list of neighbors selected by u then v is marked as covered. v becomes u 's dependant.
5. end while.

The time complexity of this greedy algrorithm is at most linear in the size of the network because at least one new CH is selected after each round of execution of the algorithm. The following theorem allows for calculating the approximation factor of the solution.

Theorem 4: This algorithm computes a ln approximation compared to the optimal size- 
dominating set.

Proof: Let v be a CH selected in an optimal size-  dominating set. Each dependant of v is given an equal

cost of

. We can calculate the total cost of

min(d (v), )

N (v) , denoted by C*(v) as follows. C*(v) = 1 if

d (v) <  ; and C*(v) = d (v) if d (v)… . On the 
other hand, the total cost of N (v) in a size- 

dominating set obtained by the greedy algorithm is C(v) ,

calculated as follows.

If

d(v) < 

then

 C(v)„ d (v)11„ ln(d (v))  O (1)

Thus,

[h] = maxvV (| Nh (v) |)…   .
By considering two cases as done in the proof of
Theorem 3, it can be showed that G0 admits a distance- h dominating set of size k if and only if G admits a (distance- h , size-  )--dominating set of size k(  [h]   1) . This completes the proof.

3.3 Distance-and-size-constrained CH Selection
The size-constrained CH selection problem and algorithm presented in the previous section work explicitly with 1hop neighbors only. We examine in this section a third variant of the CH selection, which is a combination of the two previous variants, called distance-and-sizeconstrained CH selection. The corresponding decision
problem, called (distance- h , size- )–dominating set, is defined as follows. Let k < n positive, can the network be partitioned into at most k clusters such that each CH has no more than  dependants and is at distance at most h hops from its dependants?
Analogously, we find that this problem is also NP-
complete for all h…1 and for all …2 . Due to space
limitations, we only present the proof for the NPcompleteness of this problem. The size-constrained CH selection algorithm can be easily adapted to the distanceand-size-constrained CH selection and will be left to the interested readers.
Theorem 5: The decision problem of the (distance- h , size- )–dominating set is NP-complete for all h…1 and …2 .
Proof: This proof is similar to the one of Theorem 3.
Starting from the premise that the distance- h dominating
set is NP-complete (Theorem 1), we reduce a general
instance of the distance- h dominating set to the (distanceh , size- )-dominating set problem. We present here the
sketch of this proof. To start with, this problem is clearly in NP since it can
be verified in polynomial time if each CH has at most  dependants and is at distance h hops, at most, from its
dependants. By a similar construction of a graph as in Theorem 3,
let G0 = (V0 , E0 ) be a graph with

4. Simulation
We present some simulation results in this section. Our simulations aim at showing, for the distance-constrained and the distance-and-size-constrained CH selection, the parameters that influence the network overhead such as the total number of clusters in the network and the CH
density (i.e. the average number of CHs in the distance- h
neighborhood of each node.)
In the following simulations, the distance- h CH selection algorithm is executed with h = 2 . The size-
CH selection algorithm is executed with various values of
 and also extended to cover the 2-hop neighbors. That means a CH will: (1) include a maximum of  nodes
among its uncovered direct neighbors to its cluster and (2) if all direct neighbors are covered and there is still room then include two-hop neighbors (only the ones reachable through a direct neighbor already in the cluster) until
arriving at  dependants.
It is worth pointing out that while it is feasible to
implement the CH selection algorithms to cover h…3
hops neighborhood, there may be an overhead tradeoff to consider. Such an implementation requires a signaling
protocol to collect information from all nodes up to h -
hops neighborhood (an example of this implementation is
to retransmit NHDP's Hello messages up to h hops.) This
can lead to a significant increase in local signaling
overhead as the number of Hello messages in the h -hops neighborhood grows in O (h ) .
Our simulator is written in the C language. We assume there is no loss at the communication level. In a typical simulation, our program generates a random network topology according to some input parameters. Then the CH selection algorithms are executed by the nodes on this network topology and the parameters of interest are reported. The input parameters are the total number of
nodes n in the network, the average node density  and,
only for the size-constraint algorithm, the maximum

www.IJCSI.org

allowable size  of each cluster. For a particular
simulation configuration (i.e. a particular set of input
parameters), the algorithms are executed on 20000
randomly generated network topologies and the results are averaged.
To generate a network topology from the parameters
n and  , we assume that the communication range of
each node is unitary. Therefore, two nodes are direct neighbors if and only if their euclidean distance is no more
than 1 . The n nodes are then randomly placed on a

square of size L2 with L =

n
.



To start, we compare on an identical network topology the selections of CHs with and without size constraint. Then we continue by presenting the parameters of interest for each algorithm.

4.1 Comparison of Cluster Formation

Figure 4(a) shows the formation of clusters when no size constraint is specified. We can see that the distribution of the cluster sizes is highly uneven between the clusters: four clusters (25% of the total clusters) have a size more than double that of the other clusters. Thus, the CHs of those large clusters may encounter traffic congestion. It is worth noting that, because of the border effects, nodes located far from the network borders usually have more neighbors, thus they have higher degrees, than nodes in the border's vicinity. This effect implies that the nodes far from the borders are susceptible to be among the first selected CHs by this algorithm.
On the other hand, Figure 4(b) shows the cluster
formation with a maximum size constraint  = 10 , which
equals the average node density. The cluster formation is more regular with most clusters having similar size. Thus, the network load is distributed more evenly among the selected CHs. However, there are almost twice as many CHs selected as in Figure 4(a) (29 CHs versus 16 CHs.)

Figure 4 compares the selections of CHs with and without size constraint for the same network topology. This
network has n = 200 nodes with an average density of  = 10 nodes per unitary disc.

4.2 Number of Clusters and CH Density
We examine in this section two parameters of interest that can influence the network efficiency: the number of clusters and the CH density. The number of clusters indicates the overhead of the network at the CH level. The CH density is calculated as the average number of CHs that each node can find in its 2-hop neighborhood. Therefore, the CH density reflects the robustness of the CH selection algorithm: in case of a CH failure, its dependants may backup immediately to an existing CH found in the 2-hop neighborhood.
It is worth mentioning that we may need a protocol to support the recovery from a CH failure. Such a protocol would allow nodes having a failed CH to know who the alternative CHs are, and negociate with candidate CHs to find a cluster to join. We may also need to allow a temporary moment when the backup CHs have to accept
new nodes even if their size exceeds the limit  before a
new CH selection procedure is triggered. Nevertheless, having multiple CHs already selected in the neighborhood, and under the assumptions that the CHs exchange their database of members with their CH peers with regard to an eventual backup, can help to recover more quickly from a CH failure compared with having to re-elect a new CH and waiting for this CH to collect all the information about the members before disseminate it into the networks.
4.2.1 Number of clusters
Figure 5 compares the number of clusters formed by each selection algorithm. The total number of nodes in the network varies from 20 to 100 nodes. The node density

ISSN (Online): 1694-0814

www.IJCSI.org

varies from 5 to 10 nodes per unitary disc. For size-
constrained CH selection (Figure 5(b)), we fixed  = 10 .
We can see that the number of clusters formed by both algorithms increases almost linearly with the number of nodes in the network. This trend is true independently of
the node density. In sparse networks ( = 5, 6, 7 ), there

are slightly more clusters when the cluster size is limited
to  = 10 than when it is not. This gap becomes larger for dense networks (  = 10 ): 14 clusters with size constraint compared to 8 clusters without size constraint for a network of 100 nodes. However, it is still a very
efficient way to reduce signaling overhead compared to a flat network, because the number of CHs is less then 20% of the total number of nodes.

Fig. 6. Comparison of the CH density between size-constrained and no size-constrained for distance-2 CH selection in a network of
n = 20..100 nodes and density  = 5..10 .

Notice that for dense networks (  = 8, 9,10 ), the
curves in Figure 6(a) show a slight decrease in CH density
for n = 40..80 nodes. This is due to the border effects: for dense and small networks ( = 8, 9,10 and n„ 40
nodes), there are more nodes affected by the border effects. Therefore, some CHs located in the border areas cover less nodes than other CHs in the center, resulting in a higher ratio of CHs per node.
It is clear from Figure 6(a) that the distance-2 CH selection without cluster size constraint cannot ensure backup in the event of CHs' failure, as its average CH
density is only 1.7 CHs per node at most. That means if
some CHs fail then at least 30% of the dependants cannot find a second CH in their 2-hop neighborhood for an immediate backup. With the size constraint CH selection
(cf. Figure 6(b)), most networks with density …7 can
ensure an immediate backup since the CH density is always higher than 2.

5. Conclusions
We investigate in this paper the complexity and performance of different cluster head (CH) selections in MANETs. Two variants of CH selection are examined. The first variant (a.k.a. distance-constrained) selects a set of CHs such that every node in the network is either a CH
or is located within distance h hops away from the
nearest CH. The second variant (a.k.a. size-constrained)
limits the maximum size of each cluster to  members. A
third variant, combining the distance and size constraints, is also presented.
The decision problems of these variants are showed to be NP-complete for a general network graph. We propose two distributed algorithms for these CH selections. Each algorithm has logarithmic approximation ratio, which is known to be best possible unless NP has superpolynomial time algorithms. The time complexity of these algorithms is at most linear in the size of the network.
Our simulation results show that the distanceconstrained CH selection can find a smaller CH set compared to the distance-and-size-constrained selection. However, the cluster size is unevenly distributed among the clusters. This may create congestion at some CHs if they have to relay a large amount of traffic for their dependants. The simulations also show that the distanceand-size-constrained CH selection can solve this issue by selecting more CHs in the network. The clusters then have similar size.
Also according to our simulations, while the number of clusters in the network increases linearly with the network size for both algorithms, the CH selection with size constraint can offer a more robust connectivity to the dependants. Its CH density is higher than 2 for most network configurations. That means if some CHs fail, their dependants may be able to find an existing CH in the neighborhood ready for a quick backup. Notice that this backup feature needs an additional protocol to help nodes recovering from a CH failure, which is a subject for further research.
Another issue relevant to the clustering performance is the management of node mobility and topology changes. We believe that the consideration of topology changes in CH selection algorithms is challenging and has the merit of being examined separately in a future study.

Abstract
This paper describes an experiment investigating the effectiveness and user satisfaction of using anthropomorphic feedback at the user interface. The context chosen was online bidding due to this kind of activity being very much used in current times by general users. The main results of the experiment were that there was a statistically significant effect observed for the time taken to place a bid in the anthropomorphic text condition. However there were no other significant effects for effectiveness issues and user satisfaction indicators. The results were also analysed in terms of the affordances and the main findings were that each of the four conditions tested in the experiment were probably equivalent in terms of their facilitating the affordances. Overall it may be more important to facilitate the affordances rather than a type of feedback being anthropomorphic in nature or not.
Keywords: Anthropomorphic, affordances, user interface
evaluation.
1. Introduction
For several years research into anthropomorphic user interface feedback has been conducted. However, despite many claims in the literature, there is no overall pattern of results that could aid user interface developers to make a good informed choice for the use of such feedback in a software system.
Therefore, the main objective of this research is to aid in the improvement of user interfaces by better understanding the effects of using anthropomorphic user interface feedback. Specific concentration is placed on comparing anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic user interfaces to address the issues of effectiveness and user satisfaction in relation to context and domain and to provide some explanation of the results in terms of an appropriate theory such as the theory of affordances.
There are various opinions amongst the computer science community regarding the effectiveness and user

satisfaction of anthropomorphic feedback at the user interface. Some researchers are in favour of anthropomorphism, e.g. Koda and Maes [10], Maes [13], Laurel [11], Agarwal [1], Zue [33] and Takeuchi and Naito [30]. However, some researchers are not generally in favour of anthropomorphism in most circumstances e.g. Shneiderman and Plaisant [29]. Each of these researchers tends to base their opinions on various studies conducted in the area. As stated, due to the inconclusive nature of the results of these studies, there is the need for more work in this area to gain a better understanding of such differences in opinion and experimental results.
The rest of this paper will consider some key previous research, then the experiment conducted will be described in detail along with the experimental results and conclusions. Further, the results will be discussed in the context of affordances.
2. Some Key Previous Research
This section will aim to discuss research which has already been carried out by others and the authors of this paper on anthropomorphism and highlight some of the differences in results obtained by other researchers. Research about anthropomorphism spans various contexts including agent-based software.
The first paper to consider was an experimental study by Moreno et al [16] in the context of tutoring and learning about plants, they found that experimental participants using an anthropomorphic agent were better able to use their newly learned knowledge to solve similar problems in the same domain. They also found that participants in this group had more motivation to continue learning about plants and had overall more interest in the subject area. No difference was found for actual memory capacity. The control group used the same information as in the anthropomorphic agent group, but the agent was substituted with text.

Another study in the area of tutoring by Moundridou and Virvou [15] tested 2 conditions in an algebra tutoring environment. The first condition had a talking synthetic face and the second was the same as the first condition with text replacing the synthetic face. The main results showed that there was no significant difference between the 2 conditions for task time completion. However the participants in the anthropomorphic condition enjoyed the experience more, found the system more useful and less difficult to use.
The studies by Moreno et al [16] and Moundridou and Virvou [15] were in similar contexts, but the results were not the same. Moreno et al's [16] study showed more positive outcomes in favour of anthropomorphic feedback compared to the study by Moundridou and Virvou [15]. Although it is acknowledged that the measures used in each study were slightly different and could be a factor. However the results for user perceptions were similar, where the anthropomorphic feedback fostered more positive user perceptions.
In another study by Catrambone et al [3] an experiment was conducted using an editing environment and a travel items recommendation environment. Three conditions were tested with these two environments. The first condition was an animated agent, the second was a still photograph of the same agent used in the first condition and the third was a cartoon image of a lit light bulb. The tasks involved doing some editing in an unknown word processor and making some choices regarding what items to take on an international trip. During the editing task the agent was reactive in nature, while in the travel items task the agent was proactive. The main results were that for the travel task, the participants were generally influenced by the agent’s suggestions. However no effect was recorded for type of agent. In the editing task, there was no difference in task time across the 3 conditions. Further, the participants felt that the agent was less intrusive and more worthwhile in the editing task than in the travel task. Also the participants were observed to be at ease in querying the agent for help in the editing task while the converse was true for the travel items task.
Furthermore in a related study by Xiao et al [32] an experiment was conducted in an editing environment testing three experimental conditions. The first was a reactive anthropomorphic agent, the second was also an agent that was reactive and proactive in nature and the third was a control condition consisting of an approximately equivalent paper based manual. The main results for the experiment show that there were no significant differences in task time and number of

commands used across the 3 conditions. After the experiment, participants were also asked to recall as many editor commands as possible. This aspect did not produce any significance across the 3 conditions. There were also no significant results in the participant opinions about the agents and paper manual.
The studies by Catrambone et al [3] and Xiao et al [32] were similar in nature, but the results clearly differ, where Catrambone et al's [3] study shows some results favouring anthropomorphic feedback, while Xiao et al's [32] study shows no differences overall in the experimental conditions used.
In a study by David et al [5], the authors conducted a three condition experiment in the context of a quiz about ancient history. They were investigating different anthropomorphic cues in terms of character gender and attitude and user perceptions about the character in relation to quiz success (or not). The overall results of their experiment suggested that anthropomorphic cues led to users believing the character to be less friendly, intelligent and fair. This finding was linked with the male character and not with the female character.
However, in a study by Qiu and Benbasat [28] a six condition experiment was conducted to test ‘perceived social relationship’ whilst interacting with a system, in the context of digital camera recommendations. The experimental conditions used in the experiment were animated face with text output, animated face with text-tospeech (TTS) output, animated face with human voice output, no face with text output, no face with TTS output and no face with human voice output. The tasks were of the kind where users dealt with digital cameras and the system provided recommendations to the user, using one of the conditions listed above. The overall results were that the conditions with an animated face elicited greater perceptions of social presence. A similar trend was observed for conditions using a human voice.
The study by Qiu and Benbasat [28] has some contrasts in results compared to the study of David et al [5]. Qiu and Benbasat report positive findings in relation to animated anthropomorphic feedback with a human voice in terms of ‘social presence’. However this is in contrast with David et al’s [5] study where anthropomorphic cues were perceived negatively in terms of friendliness, intelligence and fairness. These characteristics could also be viewed as being part of ‘social presence’ [2]. This therefore indicates a further dichotomy of results, despite the experimental contexts being different.
The discussion so far clearly suggests that using

anthropomorphic feedback in a given context does not guarantee better usability in an application. Clearly the above studies have shown that the results overall in various experiments spanning several years at times show anthropomorphism to be better or worse and in some cases not being any different to conventional type feedback. This pattern of inconsistent results in relation to using anthropomorphic feedback has also been observed in the authors’ previous work (see Murano, [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]) on anthropomorphic feedback.
In Murano [20] it was shown that in the domain of software for in-depth learning, anthropomorphic feedback was significantly more effective. The results for user satisfaction were not so clear in terms of significance. This experiment was specifically in the context of English as a Foreign Language pronunciation. However in Murano et al [23], also in the domain of in-depth learning and the context of PC building there was no difference between anthropomorphic feedback and non-anthropomorphic feedback in terms of effectiveness for the tasks. The user satisfaction tended more towards the anthropomorphic feedback.
These two experiments were clearly in the same domain and both had the context of instructing users about a particular subject matter. However the results are inconclusive in terms of researchers or practitioners overall being able to conclude that anthropomorphic feedback is better than non-anthropomorphic feedback (or vice versa) .
Specifically related to this paper, are the results by Murano [18]. The paper investigated anthropomorphic feedback in the context of online factual delivery, using the area of direction finding (way-finding) as the specific context. This paper showed with statistically significant results, that non-anthropomorphic feedback was more effective. The results for user satisfaction were not so clear, but participant preferences tended towards the nonanthropomorphic feedback.

satisfaction was inconclusive with no significant differences between the four conditions.
These two experiments are also in the same domain, but with different contexts. However the results are clearly different also suggesting a lack of an overall pattern of results.
Therefore, as mentioned in the introduction, this research is aiming to find more information regarding the usage of anthropomorphic feedback, particularly aiming to discover if such feedback is appropriate in terms of effectiveness and user satisfaction. The research is being done in various software contexts and domains. Overall some of the literature argues that differences in results could be due to high sensitivity in the tasks, measures and contexts used in an experiment. However the authors would argue that while this is a possibility, given the body of research that exists in this area, there should be a clearer pattern emerging regarding anthropomorphic feedback and its usability. Therefore with a lack of a clear pattern the authors are suggesting that there could be other explanations to the central issue of anthropomorphic feedback, its usability, and explaining the plethora of results being observed. One such explanation could concern the facilitating or lack of facilitation of the affordances at the user interface whilst presenting a type of feedback to a user.
This paper therefore investigates the domain of online factual delivery further, describing an experiment set in this domain, using again the context of online bidding to test anthropomorphic feedback. This context was chosen because it is a fairly common activity for users of all kinds to carry out over the Internet and was therefore considered to be useful and realistic, whilst maintaining the theme of the previous experiments conducted ([18] and [24]). As with the previous experiments, effectiveness and user satisfaction were the aspects being investigated.
2. Online Bidding Experiment

In a further experiment by Murano and Holt [24] in the same domain of online factual delivery with the context of online bidding, the results showed more effectiveness for an impersonal human voice. This was a four condition experiment that tested four different voice types (TTS personal voice, TTS impersonal voice, personal human voice and impersonal human voice). The effectiveness concerned users placing higher bids in the impersonal human voice condition. This was effectiveness in terms of an online bidding business owner preferring overall higher bids being placed by users if they were charging commission based on bid amounts. In this experiment user

2.1 Users
 120 participants were recruited for this experiment.  Although gender was not the main issue of this
research, the participants were students of computer science. There were 105 male participants and 15 female participants.  Participants were in the 18-35 age range.
All participants had experience or awareness of online bidding as determined through a recruitment

questionnaire. The participants were all recruited from the university population. Specific details about the participants were then elicited by means of a specially designed pre-experiment/recruitment questionnaire which principally asked specific questions about bidding experience and other online activities, e.g.

of Nass and Brave [25]. The questionnaire had three main sections where responses were made using Likert [12] type scales. These were sections concerning the general user interface, the participants’ impressions regarding the way the items were described and the participants’ feelings during the interaction, e.g.

Approximately how many times have you used online auctions. 1 – 2, 3-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-30, 31+
2.2 Experimental Design
A between users design was used for this experiment. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions. Randomness was achieved by alternately assigning each participant to one of the four conditions, until all participants had been assigned to a condition. The four conditions were anthropomorphic text, anthropomorphic text and a synthetic character, synthetic character only and a control group consisting of only neutral text. The synthetic character had a TTS voice which as in the previous experiment was a generic electronic voice.
2.3 Variables
The independent variables were (1) the types of feedback (Anthropomorphic Text, Anthropomorphic Text and Synthetic Character, Synthetic Character and Neutral Text) and (2) Type of Task (i.e. bidding on three different household items), where the values from the bids made were averaged and included in the analyses (i.e. not the tasks themselves).
The dependent variables were the participants’ performance in carrying out the tasks and their subjective opinions.
The dependent measures were that the performance was measured by examining the average bid amount. From an auction point of view, the higher the bid made, the better the business outcome. From a user’s perspective the lowest amount is the best outcome. This approach was the same as the one described in Nass and Brave [25], Huang et al [9] and is suitable because it is directly related to the bidding process, which is the main aspect of concern. Further it was decided to put the participants under pressure in the interaction by asking them to bid as quickly as possible to maximise their chance of obtaining the items. The bids and the time taken to place a bid were all recorded automatically by the prototype software. The subjective opinions were measured by means of a postexperiment questionnaire conceptually based on the work

2.5 Procedure and Tasks
The recruitment questionnaire was handed out and the completed forms were scrutinised for participant suitability. The main aspect that was required for this experiment, was to have participants with an awareness of online auctions. Also it was required by implication to have participants with computing knowledge so that the results would not be biased with issues concerning lack of knowledge in using computer systems, which could indirectly affect bidding behaviour. This was assumed though as all the participants were computer science students. Further at the beginning of the recruitment procedure, participants were informed that they would receive a fixed amount of course credits as a reward for their time.
The suitable participants were then contacted by email, where an appointment during the day was arranged.
Upon arrival the participants were welcomed and comfortably seated at the computer. Then they were informed that all the data collected as part of the experiment would be kept confidential, they could leave at any time they wanted and should they not want their data to be used after the experiment had taken place, this was their prerogative.
Then the participants were asked to read the content of a one page web site which briefly presented a scenario of their graduating from university and moving into a home of their own with the need to buy some household items from an auction. Then some information regarding the bidding process was given and lastly the participants were

informed that they would be asked to complete a postexperiment questionnaire.
When the participants indicated that they had read and understood the material, further verbal details were given regarding the auction process along with reiteration of the auction points found on the experiment web site. This was done to ensure the participants fully understood that the auction they would be using was different to the usual ‘Ebay’ type auction. Participants were also given a briefing regarding the interaction they would have with the system. The following points were therefore verbally communicated:  There would be three items and only one bid placed for
each item.  Bid as quickly as possible as they were competing with
other ‘buyers’.  The system would inform them of how many other
bids had been received for each item, along with the lowest amount bid and highest amount bid (this remained the same for all participants).  Bid an amount comparative to the actual perceived value of the item. That this auction was similar to a Vickrey type auction [31], which encouraged truth telling as the main approach to bidding. (Note: The strategy of using a Vickrey type auction was used to try and balance the bidding behaviours and bidding strategies of expert bidders in ‘Ebay’ type auctions with individuals who were perhaps less able or less strategic. It had been a concern that there may have been bias in the results if a straight ‘Ebay’ type auction had been used, as certain ‘Ebay’ users have developed various bidding strategies).  The user interface would have a section with the description of the item and another section with a form allowing bids to be typed into respective fields. Once a bid had been typed, this could be then submitted to the system via a ‘submit’ button.
After the verbal instructions were completed, the actual auction was started by launching the software. The actual descriptions appeared in a section of the user interface – in whichever feedback mode was being used. Using one of the feedback modes being tested, an initial introduction detailing that there were three items for sale was issued. Then the participant was informed that they would receive a description for each item and that they would need to bid at the end of each item’s description.
The next stage involved the system issuing the description for the first item. The description gave a guide price and a brief physical description of the item along with the number of bids already on the item and the lowest/highest amounts already bid. Once the end of the description was

reached the participant typed the bid into the appropriate field of the form on the user interface and then clicked the submit button. Once the submit button was clicked, the second description was issued in the same manner as described above. This was done for three items in total. The actual items were a futon, refrigerator and microwave oven.
During the auction process described in the previous paragraph, the software automatically logged the amount of the bid submitted and automatically recorded the time taken to place and submit a bid on each item. The timing did not include reading time, but was started when the participant begun their interaction with the software and stopped when they clicked the submit button for an item.
When the three bids had been placed, the participants were asked to complete a post-experiment questionnaire regarding their subjective opinions and feelings about their interaction experience. When this was completed, they were debriefed regarding the experiment. Specifically they were informed that they were not really bidding against others. This had been done to make the event more realistic. Then they were thanked for their time and asked to not tell anyone what they had done. Finally they were reminded that they would receive the promised course credits for their participation. This procedure was followed in the same manner for all the participants.
2.6 Results
The data collected consisted of performance and subjective opinions data. The performance data was the amount bid and the time taken to bid by participants. The subjective satisfaction data collected from the postexperiment questionnaire which used a Likert type scale involved questions in three main categories. These were the general user interface, the participants’ impressions regarding the way the items were described in the auction and the participants’ feelings during the interaction.
For the general user interface, the actual questions were about the ease of use of the user interface (UI), the usefulness of the UI, the level of satisfaction of the UI, the clarity of the text used in the UI, the comfort of the colours used in the UI and the intuitiveness of the buttons used.
For the category covering the impression of the way the items were described in the auction, the actual questions were about the clarity of the items' description, if it was like a person, if it was friendly, if it was trustworthy, if it was helpful and if it was likeable.

For the category covering the participants' feelings during the interaction, the actual questions were about whether the participant felt relaxed, comfortable, happy, excited and motivated.

These data were analysed using a multifactorial analysis of variance and when significance was found, the particular issue was then subjected to post-hoc testing for confirmation purposes and to isolate differences from the multifactorial analysis of variance, using a Tukey HSD test.

Interestingly, there was only one significant result observed and this is presented below. All the other nonsignificant results are not presented in this paper for the sake of brevity.

Firstly the mean and standard deviation is presented for the results in Table 1 below:

For the variables ‘Average Time’ and ‘group’ there was a

significant (p < 0.05) difference. The anthropomorphic

text group on average took significantly longer to place a

bid on the items being ‘sold’, compared to the participants

in the other 3 conditions. The F-ratio is 3.82* and this

significance was confirmed by the post-hoc test (not

Lastly the data were also analysed by including the participants as a source of random variation to see if these could have caused some effect. The analysis suggests that there were no actual individual participant effects in the data.

significant differences between the four conditions being tested.
Furthermore it is unexplained why the anthropomorphic text group seemed to take significantly longer to place a bid than the other three groups under investigation. The timing process in this experiment did not include reading time, i.e. the timing was started when the participants began their interaction with the software. If it had included the reading time, this could perhaps have helped explain the observations, however as this was not the case, the matter remains unexplained. A further aspect that could be suggested is that perhaps the timing mechanism during the observation was flawed for this particular group. However this is not the case either, as the timings were done automatically by the software and had been well tested beforehand and at regular intervals between experimental sessions, for consistency and accuracy.
Another issue that could be raised is that perhaps the participants in the anthropomorphic text group were not ‘equivalent’ to the other participants in the remaining three conditions. This can be suggested by the fact that the standard deviations accompanying the mean times for each experimental group are approximately equivalent for all the experimental groups, except for the anthropomorphic text group, which had a considerably higher standard deviation (actual SD figures not included for brevity). This seems to have occurred despite the fact that measures were taken to ensure that this did not happen. This included using a large enough sample (30 in each group) and screening the participants for certain desirable characteristics. It was desired to have at least participants that had knowledge of bidding etc, and an approximately equivalent level of education (computer science university students) - this was achieved.
3. The Theory of Affordances and the Results
As mentioned above, the authors are suggesting that there may be other explanations for the lack of a clear pattern of results concerning the usability of anthropomorphic feedback. One such explanation could concern the facilitating or lack of facilitation of the affordances at the user interface whilst presenting a type of feedback to a user.

2.7 Results Discussion
No significance was found on the actual amounts bid and the experimental conditions being tested. Furthermore the various post-experiment questions designed to elicit ‘satisfaction’ (or not) responses, did not reveal any

Gibson [7] was the first researcher to systematically study and propose physical affordances. As the affordances in relation to a computer user interface are different to the affordances discussed by Gibson, a detailed consideration of Gibson’s theory is beyond the scope of this paper. However, to set the scene, it would be useful to briefly mention what Gibson meant by using the word

‘affordance’. Firstly his theory of affordances concerned organisms and their interaction and reaction with some environment. Further, the word ‘affordance’ is a fabrication on Gibson’s part [7]. Secondly, some of his thoughts can be described by means of one of his many examples. He describes a surface which is flat and solid in some way as ‘affording’ some sort of support, e.g. for an organism to walk. Conversely a surface that is flat but not rigid, such as a body of water, does not ‘afford’ the act of walking on this surface (for a human). Thirdly, the issues concerning an organism interacting and reacting to some environment are linked with how one sees and perceives aspects of the environment [7].
However, the initial theory of affordances has been reinterpreted for application to user interfaces. Norman [26, 27] and Hartson [8] are the main sources of the reinterpretations, with more lightweight contributions from Gaver [6] and McGrenere and Ho [14], where they started to apply affordances to computer systems and to decompose affordances into different components.
In the authors' opinion the most substantial effort has been conducted by Hartson [8]. He identifies cognitive, physical, functional and sensory affordances. His rationale is that when doing some computer related task, the users are using cognitive, physical and sensory actions. Cognitive affordances involve ‘a design feature that helps, supports, facilitates, or enables thinking and/or knowing about something’ [8]. One example of this aspect concerns giving feedback to a user that is clear and precise. If one labels a button, the label should convey to the user what will happen if the button is clicked. Physical affordances are ‘a design feature that helps, aids, supports, facilitates, or enables physically doing something’ [8]. According to Hartson a button that can be clicked by a user is a physical object acted on by a human and its size should be large enough to elicit easy clicking. This would therefore be a physical affordance characteristic. Functional affordances concern having some purpose in relation to a physical affordance. One example is that clicking on a button should have some purpose with a goal in mind. The converse is that indiscriminately clicking somewhere on the screen is not purposeful and has no goal in mind. This idea is also mentioned in McGrenere and Ho [14]. Lastly, sensory affordances concern ‘a design feature that helps, aids, supports, facilitates or enables the user in sensing (e.g. seeing, feeling, hearing) something’ [8]. Sensory affordances are linked to the earlier cognitive and physical affordances as they complement one another. This means that the users need to be able to ‘sense’ the cognitive and physical affordances so that these affordances can help the user.

To recap this experiment detailed in this paper had four different kinds of feedback in the bidding context. The results for effectiveness and user satisfaction were inconclusive. Due to the nature of the conditions involved and the fact that the user interface was identical under each of the four conditions, the authors conclude that the affordances should have been the same or similar irrespective of the four different conditions. The four conditions being tested were anthropomorphic text, anthropomorphic text and a character, character only, and a control of neutral text. On the surface it could appear initially that these different conditions would have fostered different affordances, because some of the conditions were textual only and some had a synthetic character. However this may not have been the case. Firstly all four conditions would have satisfied the cognitive affordance aspect. This is because they would all have facilitated ‘knowing’ or obtaining the necessary information required to be able to place a bid on the items. While the conditions did have different modes of information presentation (e.g. text or character with a voice), given the context and the amount of information being presented, these modes of presentation would have all satisfied the sensory affordances aspect, which deals with some feature of the software facilitating the user ‘seeing’ or ‘ hearing’ something. It would have perhaps been a different matter if the information being presented was much more complex and lengthier in nature. The physical affordances aspect would have been identical across the four conditions, because the interface being used across the four conditions consisted of elements for presenting the information to the user and identical elements for entering and submitting bids across the four conditions. This argument also applies to the functional affordances supporting the physical affordances. The user interface elements that facilitated the entering and submitting of bids were clear regarding their purpose, particularly as all participants were briefed in the same manner regarding how bids should have been placed using the system. Looking back to the statistical results for this experiment, there were no clear results to give further indications regarding the reasons for the observed phenomena. One significant result was observed which involved the average time taken to place a bid and the anthropomorphic text group. This group took significantly longer to place a bid compared with the other three groups or conditions. It could be argued that perhaps this condition did not foster appropriate affordances compared with the other three conditions. However this argument is flawed, because if this was true, one would expect that the textual control group and/or the anthropomorphic text and character group to be more closely aligned to this result as they were more similar to each other. However this was not the case, their times were actually closer to the

character only group. However as discussed above this result is unlikely to be an issue of the affordances being adversely affected.

4. Recommendations and Future Work
The authors do suggest further work in this area, particularly where it would be a logical consequence of the authors' experiments to develop further experiments where certain experimental conditions were developed to purposely not facilitate the affordances and compare these with other experimental conditions that specifically facilitated the affordances. If the above arguments are correct, then one would expect that effectiveness and user satisfaction would be greater in the experimental conditions facilitating the affordances and the expectation would be that this kind of result would be statistically significant. However, until further results are available concerning the effects of facilitating the affordances at the user interface, it is suggested that the current available evidence concerning the facilitation of the affordances could be heeded in current interface design to aid usability.

This paper has presented and discussed an experiment and the main results of the experiment. The experiment was in the context of online bidding and anthropomorphic user interface feedback. The results have been examined in light of the theory of affordances as interpreted by Hartson [8]. The authors argue that each experimental condition did not differ significantly enough with respect to the facilitation of the affordances at the user interface and therefore this is the main reason for not having obtained more significant results indicating differences in the user interface. However, despite this, the work presented in this paper does add new knowledge to the existing body of knowledge in this area. Also the authors suggest that the facilitation of the affordances is probably more important for usability of an interface than the actual presence of anthropomorphic feedback or not.

Abstract
Both free and low-priced mobile wireless networks are expanding and its users are more numerous every day. This success is particularly due to the mobility offered to users. These networks have promoted and widespread the success and availability of mobile devices and their access technologies such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX and Bluetooth. Nevertheless, despite of their wide success, the problem is that those technologies do not match the everyday privacy and security requirements expected by the users. In this paper we focus on the Wi-Fi technology and we propose a reputation system that assesses the trust level of a WiFi Access Point (AP). We obtain this trust level according to users past experiences. We have validated our proposed solution through simulation using the dynamic simulation tool AnyLogic and comparing the results of our solution to those of two previous well-known trust metrics: EigenTrust and Salem metrics.

management.
1. Introduction
The number of APs in the world has increased significantly: they have widely spread in many locations like airports, cafes, businesses and university campuses. This fact coupled with the inherent vulnerabilities of the deployed technologies, has provoked a security breach. In addition to typical network threats, wireless networks present several challenges and specific attack types. This is due to the wide open air nature of the channel, allowing more attacks, bandwidth limitations and constant topology changes because of node mobility. Furthermore, a lot of security breaches have been registered, such as Service Set Identifier (SSID) spoofing using soft AP. To steal credit card numbers and other personal information, thieves are using a soft AP to masquerade as a legitimate wireless AP. For instance, it has been reported [1] that fake Wi-Fi networks have been set up in many airports in order to capture users’ sensitive information as they surf the Web during their connection to those networks. It is important to know whether the Wi-Fi APs within range are

trustworthy or not as in some locations it is not rare to find more than five potential Wi-Fi networks to connect to.
In our solution, we propose to evaluate the trustworthiness level of the AP according to previous experiences of the users. This can help users to detect which AP is the most trustworthy by taking into account the opinions of previous users as well as their friends’ recommendations, in order to polish the selection of trustworthy available APs. The users will then use this trust value in order to connect to the best AP. With our trust and reputation system, the user will detect the bad APs and will isolate them by giving them a low trust value. In our simulations this reputation system, called TrustedHotspot, has significantly increased the chances to choose the most trustworthy wireless AP, even under a variety of bad conditions, i.e. with bad Wi-Fi networks in place and even with malicious users cooperating in an attempt to deliberately subvert the system by giving a wrong rating to an AP. We have validated our proposed solution under resource constraints through simulation, based on the dynamic simulation tool AnyLogic. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the problem statement and related work. In Section 3, we present our solution and its assumptions. Section 4 presents how we have implemented our trust metrics to validate it and presents also a comparison with another trust metrics such as Salem metrics and EigenTrust metrics. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.

location. This is due mainly to the great success of commercial and shared Wi-Fi access. For the user, it is important to know if the hotspot is trustworthy, and in order to do that, we have to provide the means to the users to evaluate the hotspot and at the same time our solution has to be robust against attacks. The goal of this work is to present an easy deployable solution that:
 Evaluates the level of the trustworthiness of the AP.
 Prevents the user from choosing malicious APs.  Encourages the owner of the AP to act correctly.
2.2 Problem Statement
Salem et al. [5] proposes a reputation system that enables the user to choose the best hotspot and discourages the wireless Internet service providers (WISPs) from providing a bad quality of Service (QoS) to the mobile nodes. In this paper, they consider a mobile node (MN) that is affiliated with a home network and that wants to connect to the Internet via a hotspot managed by a wireless Internet service provider. The behavior of each WISP in their model is characterized by what they call a reputation record. This record represents an evaluation of the reputation of the WISP and it is generated and signed by a trusted central authority. The reputation mechanism is maintained by the same trusted central authority. When a WISP first enters the network, the trusted central authority provides it with an initial reputation record, that can afterwards increase (i.e., better reputation) or decrease, depending on the behavior of the WISPs. If the MN has two neighboring WISPs that propose equivalent offers, i.e., same QoS and price, the MN will choose to connect to the access point managed by the WISP that has the best reputation record. They use a micropayment scheme to make sure that the MNs will pay for the service they received. Our solution is related to this one, but the key difference is that it can work on free or paid networks. We focus our work mostly on the selection of the most trustworthy AP and on preventing the user from connecting to malicious APs. In Nicholson et al. [6], the selection algorithm focuses on the AP’s signal strength as an important metric. It presents an extensive field study conducted on three different neighborhoods in Chicago, which shows that choosing an AP based on signal strength makes the user to miss significant opportunities for Internet connectivity. They describe the design and implementation of Virgil, an automatic AP discovery and selection system which quickly associates to each AP found during a scan, and runs a battery of tests designed to discover the AP’s use suitability by estimating the bandwidth and round-triptime to a set of reference servers. Virgil also probes for blocked or redirected ports, to guide the selection in favor

of preserving the application services currently in use. Their results show that Virgil finds a usable connection from 22% to 100% more often than when simply using a selection based on signal strength alone. Virgil improves both performance and accuracy for neighborhoods that the user commonly travels, by caching AP test results. Their work focuses on estimation of bandwidth and round-triptime to assess the AP whereas our solution proposes to use the algorithm TrustedHotspot in order to prevent the user to connect to malicious hotspots. The paper by Ormond et al. [7] further examines network selection decision in wireless heterogeneous networks based on a user-centric approach, which they say that allows a user to choose the network which meets their best requirements. Their network selection algorithm predicts the data rate on each interface available to the mobile node and makes a decision based on those predictions. Their approach is very interesting because they focus on the user requirements or preferences although they do not prevent the user from connecting to malicious hotspots as we do.
3. Our Solution and Its Assumptions
Section 3.1 presents the assumptions and gives an overview of our solution. In Section 3.2 we describe the trust and reputation model used and finally in Section 3.3 we present the formulas used by our solution.
3.1 Assumptions
We consider a user who has a mobile phone (MP) that integrates the Wi-Fi technology and who wants to connect to an AP as depicted in Figure 1. Our solution provides an Android application in order to rate the AP and sends this rating to our server. This application generates a public (PuK) / private (PrK) key pair in order to sign the message exchange. The MP sends to our server his public key in order to identify who is sending the rating. In our solution, we use a trust mechanism to discourage the APs from providing a bad QoS. The trust management is used during the selection process of the best AP in accordance to the trust value of each of them. Thanks to our trust and reputation mechanism, the APs are encouraged to behave correctly: they cannot provide a bad QoS if they want to obtain a high trust value, and hence, a good reputation. By bad QoS we mean that is not good enough for the user to successfully use an application while connected to the AP. In this paper, we assume that:
 Our server is trusted by the other parties.  The user is not able to create many identities in
order to cheat, for example, using the Sybil Attacks [2].We assume that the MP has a SIM

card which unambiguously authenticates the identity of the user with a provider.
 The connection to our server is done through 3G, GPRS.

 The AP has an unlimited amount of energy and a uniform transmission range.

In order to aggregate the rating, it is necessary to normalize it in some manner. Otherwise, malicious users can assign an arbitrarily high rating to the AP. We define a normalized rating in the following way:

Figure 1. System Model
3.2 Trust and Reputation Model
The behavior of each AP in our model is characterized by what we call a trust value. This trust value represents the trust level of the AP, based on the previous experiences of the users with that AP, and it is signed and sent to our server. The trust value of an AP is represented in the range [0…1], being 0 untrustworthy and 1 very trustworthy. When an AP first enters the network the server provides it with an initial trust value equal to 0.5, which can afterwards increase or decrease, depending on the behavior of the AP. The users have the possibility to ask to their friends for recommendations about a given AP. The user will be able to become friend with other users and they will store all their information about their friends and the APs used by them in our server. The connection to our server will be done by using GPRS or 3G. In Balasubramanian et al. [8] they have compared the energy consumption between 3G, GSM and Wi-Fi and their results showed that wireless is more energy efficient. So, if the user has the choice between 3G and Wi-Fi it will be more efficient to choose the last one. This is why 3G will only be used to retrieve the information which will help the user to choose the most trustworthy AP. The recommendations are useful when the users have not any information about an AP. We will explain how recommendations work in more detail in Section 3.3. After using the AP, the user will be presented with five different rating possibilities:

The ratings of the users are aggregated in our server. In order to make his choice when selecting an AP, the user will have information from his friends, from the aggregation of the ratings of all users and from his own previous experiences with that AP. By having information from many different sources, it will be easier for the user to choose the most appropriate and trustworthy AP. We implement some of our functions on our server to avoid unnecessarily overloading the network with messages and to avoid consuming energy or using a lot of resources on the MP of the user. Our solution proposes a trust/reputation management system in order to help users to choose the most trustworthy AP. Two thresholds are used: K1 and K2 with K2> K1. Using those thresholds, we have defined three cases:
 First case: the user will not connect to an AP if the trust value is lower than K1.
 Second case: the user will connect his MP to the AP when the trust value of it is between K1 and K2. In this case we assume that the user will trust the hotspot.
 Third case: the user will connect to an AP if K2 is lower than the trust value of it. In this case we assume that the user will fully trust the hotspot.
To apply this algorithm, our solution needs trust functions in order to compute the trust value.
3.3 Functions used by our Solution
As in any other reputation system, we must take into account the trustworthiness of the users as some of them can try to cheat by providing assessments that do not correspond to the real performance of the AP. To avoid this, each user has a trust value stored on the server side and the server will not validate ratings from users whose trust value is higher than 1. At the beginning all users will have their trust value at 0 and it will be incremented by 1 each time the user will cheat. The trust value of the user is completely

different of the trust value of the AP. The trust value will be reset to 0 at the end of the week in order to prevent the user to cheat easily.
We have implemented five functions in order to compute the trust value. These functions are implemented on different elements of our trust model such as the MP, the AP and our server.

Facebook platform. When a user will ask for a recommendation, the Facebook platform will compute his friend list and will send it back to the server, where the function is stored and the recommendation will be computed.

Function 1 is responsible to compute the trust value of an AP on the user side, in accordance to the feedback from the user where “n” is the number of ratings of the user on “AP”. This function aggregates on the MP all the past ratings of the user and its result will be in the range [0…1].
Function 2 is responsible to aggregate all the ratings sent by all the users who have used the AP where “m” is the number of users who have used “AP” and who have a trust value lower than 1. It computes the contextual trust value of the AP and it is implemented on the server side with its result on the range [0…1].
Function 3 is responsible to compute the Friendshipfactor between the users. We consider nblink as the level of friendship. As we do not know in which context two users have become friends, we need to add a weight which we call Friendshipfactor. The argument nblink defines the number of hops between two friends and it is likely to be inferior or equal to 6 according to the theory of Small World [3]. The result of this function is further used in the computation of the recommendation and it is implemented in our server.
Function 4 is responsible to compute the recommendations coming from the user’s friends and it takes into account the Friendshipfactor. We consider “Ui” all friends of the user “U” and “Friendshipfactor” the specific weight of that friendship. The argument “f” is the total amount of friends of the user “U” and “AP” represents the AP. This function is implemented using some of the functionality of the

Function 5 is responsible to compute the trust value of an AP when the user has several hotspots available. The user will use this function to compute the trust value of each AP available. The variable λ represents the weight of the trust value computed on the server side, the variable ß represents the weight of the trust value computed on the user side and the variable represents the weight of the recommendations coming from friends.
4. Implementation and Validation
We have implemented our functions and validated our solution with AnyLogic, which is a simulation tool that supports all the most common simulation methodologies: System Dynamics, Process-centric (a.k.a. Discrete Event), and Agent Based modeling. It is based on Real-time UML and Java object-oriented language. In Section 4.1 we present the model set-up. In Section 4.2 we describe the validation methodology employed. In Section 4.3 we present the scenario and the results of the simulation with our trust metrics and finally in section 4.4 we compare the results of our solution to two well-known trust metrics: EigenTrust and Salem metrics.
4.1 Model Set-up
The basic element of an agent based model is the agent itself. By using an agent based model, we have created a new class than behaves as an AP. Each device is associated to a given agent matching its location. As the device is not static, we have modeled its mobility using X and Y random variables. The movement and the status of our agents are controlled by a state-chart which represents the exact behavior of the device [Fig.2].

status of the AP and NormalUser which means that the User will not cheat and will give a fair rating.

4.2 Geneva APs Scenario

Figure 2. State-chart: Fix APs and Mobile Users
In Figure 2, each agent starts in an “Actors” state in the state-chart. A part of our agents were APs, so some of them switch to the state “AccessPoint” and the rest switch to the state “MobileDevice”.

In our experiments, we validated our proposed solution and analyzed the extended performance under a range of various mobility scenarios. All nodes are moving over rectangular 8.69 km x 6.08 km topography. In our simulations, we considered that the APs were those taken from Geneva hotspots and the nodes were the mobile users with their MP. The coverage of the APs is limited to 100 meters and each mobile device was configured to have a maximum communication range equal to 100 meters. We deployed the APs in an incremental mode, from AP1 to APn, in the exact position taken from the real GPS coordinates. Thus we estimated the impact of our solution for an existing network depending on the previous experiences of the users. The movement pattern of the mobile clients was totally randomized, in order to comply with a real hotspot scenario. To achieve this, we used the Random WayPoint (RWP) mobility model [4] with a pause time equal to that of the time of network access and data transfer. We carried out our experiments considering thirty cases. In each studied case, we ran our simulation with different conditions. Figure 4 shows the launching interface and Figure 5 shows the animation interface. The circles are APs and the square shapes are users whose colors correspond to their behavior. In the background of the animation, we placed the APs according to their GPS location on the map of Geneva.

Figure 3. State-chart for Access Point and User

The two kinds of agents were placed in the map according to their GPS positions taken from Swiss hotspots reference 1 . The rest of our agents were considered as mobile nodes and each of them followed a random mobility model. The MobileDevice represents the user with his MP and it connects to an AP that is in range. As can be seen in Figure 3, the “AccessPoint” agents can have three different states: Malicious which means that the AP is not good and its trust value is lower than 0.5, Normal which means that the AP is good and its trust value is higher than 0.5 and SuspiciousAP which means that the AP can change his status. The “MobileDevice” agents can have two different states: MaliciousUser which means that the User will cheat by giving wrong ratings meaning that the rating will not correspond to the real

4.3 Scenario and Results with our Metrics
In this section we present the scenarios of our simulations. We use 230 users, 230 APs and K1=0.5, K2=0.8. We chose K1 is 0.5 because it prevents users to select malicious APs that have a trust value lower than 0.5. According to simulation tests the best value of K2 is 0.8. We use low number of users and APs because when we will first deploy our solution we will have few users and APs. In our future work, we will increase the number of users and APs in order to see the impact of high density of users and APs. We will have different kinds of simulation: one with normal and malicious APs; one with only malicious APs; one with normal, malicious and suspicious APs; one with malicious users.
 APN (AP Normal): Is an AP with trust value higher or equals to 0.5
 APM (AP Malicious): Is an AP with a trust value lower than 0.5.
 APS (AP Suspicious): Is an AP normal which can become malicious or APS is an AP malicious which can become normal.
 UN (User Normal): Is a user who rate correctly meaning if he used APN he will rate goodly and if he used APM he will rate badly.
 UM (User Malicious): Is a user who rate badly meaning if he used APN he will rate badly and if he used APM he will rate goodly.
Simulation 1
We have 230 users, 230 APs. In the 230 APs we have 207 APNs and 23 APMs, K1=0.5 and K2 =0.8. All APs at the beginning of each simulation have as trust value 0.5.

Simulation 2 We have 230 users, 230 APs and these APs are APMs, K1=0.5 and K2 =0.8. All APs at the beginning of each simulation have as trust value 0.5.
Figure 7. Result of Simulation 2
In the second simulation we have only APMs. The result shows that the number of users using APMs is decreasing every round. This happens because when the user connects to an APM, he rates it thus lowering the trust value of the APM under 0.5 which is the value of K1. When all APMs will be used by the users they will become untrustworthy. So after receiving the evaluation of users, the trust value of the APMs decreases and so it prevents future users to connect to those APM again.
Simulation 3 In this simulation we test the robustness of our solution against the attack of behavior change of AP. There are two cases of behavior change:
 When the trust value of AP is lower than 0.5 because of user evaluations, so it will start to have good behavior. In this case, K1 will prevent users to connect to this kind of AP because the trust value of this AP will be lower than K1.
 When the trust value of the AP is above 0.9 then it will start to have bad behavior.
We have 230 users, 230 APs with 19 APSs, 22 APMs, K1=0.5 and K2=0.8. All APs at the beginning of each simulation have as trust value 0.5

Figure 6. Result of Simulation 1

Figure 6 shows at the beginning that we have some users that use APMs. After the first round, meaning after the hotspot received for the first time the evaluation of the user, we can see that the number of users using APMs decreases and the number of users using normal APs increases. Thus, our solution helps users to choose the most trustworthy AP and prevents them to use APMs.

Figure 8. Result of Simulation 3
Figure 8 shows how our solution behaves when there are some APNs, APSs and APMs. After the first round, meaning after the hotspots received for the first time the evaluation of the users, we can see that the number of users using APMs decreases and that the number of users using APNs increases. Thus, our solution helps users to connect to the most trustworthy AP and prevents them to

use APMs. After the first round we can also see that there are around 15 users that are using APSs, but in the next rounds we can check how the number of users connected to an APS is decreasing until reaching 0 showing that our solution can deal with this kind of behavior changing APs.
Simulation 4 We have 211 APNs, 184 UNs, 46 UMs, 19 APS,K1=0.5 and K2=0.8. All APs at the beginning of each simulation have as trust value 0.5 and all users have as trust value 0.
Figure 9. Result of Simulation 4
In this simulation we introduce UMs and APS at the same time. When an APS with a trust value lower than 0.5 even if it starts to act goodly no user will connect to this AP because of the threshold K1 that have as value 0.5.For the APS which have a trust value above 0.9, when they start to act badly and become malicious they receive bad rating from users, so their trust value decrease and like that the number of users using these APs decreases also. The UMs are characterized by rating in an unfairly way an APN and/or rating as good an APM. As we can see in the first round, we have less than 10 malicious users using normal APs. The number decreases after three rounds until it reaches 0 UMs connected to APNs, because each time that a UM connects to an AP their trust value is incremented (+1). By doing that we can filter the rating coming from “trusted users” who have a trust value lower than 1. So our solution can deal with UMs that try to cheat by rating badly an APN and/or rating goodly an APM.

characterized by a triplet (AQW, RQW, PW) where AQW is the QoS advertised by W, RQW is the real QoS provided by W and PW is the price W is asking for. he considers that a WISP (wireless Internet service provider) W is honest if it advertises the real QoS it is offering (i.e., RQW = AQW), misbehaving if it advertises a QoS that is higher that the real QoS it is offering (i.e., RQW < AQW) and modest if it advertises a QoS that is lower than the real QoS it is offering (i.e., RQW > AQW). He initializes the reputation of the WISPs to maxRR = 100. At the end of each session, MN (Mobile Node) sends to TCA (Trusted Central Authority) its satisfaction level Sl = QoSEvalW where QoSEvalW = RQW/AQW Each simulation lasts for 50000 seconds and the reputation updates are made every 2000 seconds. The new reputation RRW (t + 1) of W is computed as follows: RRW (t + 1) = ß · RRW (t) + (1 − ß) ·feedbackW/nbSW where RRW (t) is the current reputation of W, nbSW is the number of sessions established by W (and already closed) during the last 2000 seconds and feedback is the sum of all QoSEvalW received over all these sessions (the absence of feedback is considered as QoSEvalW = 0 ). ß represents the “weight of the past” and is set to 1/2 in their simulations.
 APN will have RQW = AQW  APM will have RQW < AQW.  APS will change between APN and APM.
Simulation 5 We have 230 users, 230 APs. In the 230 APs we have 207 APNs and 23 APMs. All APs at the beginning of each simulation have as trust value 100.

4.4 Results with Salem Metrics and EigenTrust Metrics

Figure 10. Result of Simulation 5

First we simulate the same scenario with Salem trust metrics in subsection 4.4.1. In subsection 4.4.2 we simulate the same scenario with EigenTrust trust metrics. We compare the results with all simulated trust metrics in subsection 4.4.3.
4.4.1 Salem
We compare our solution with the solution presented in Salem et al. [5] because it is the solution that tackles the most similar topic to ours, which is that of selecting the most trustworthy AP. So with Salem solution each AP is

The number of normal users using APMs increases each time. This is possible because there is not any threshold to prevent users from connecting to APMs. There are more users using APNs than user using APMs, so the solution of Salem et al. promotes the selection of APNs but still the number of user using APMs is too high. By comparing it with our solution, we can notice that our solution decreases the number of users using APMs.

Simulation 6 We have 230 users, 230 APMs, K1=0.5 and K2=0.8. All APs at the beginning of each simulation have as trust value 100.
Figure 11. Result of Simulation 6
Figure 11 shows how Salem solution behaves when there are only malicious APs. As we can see, with Salem solution a lot of users use APMs because of the fact that Salem algorithm forces to use the AP who has the best reputation value among other APs even if all the APs have a low reputation value. Our solution prevents this case to happen, because the user will connect to an APM only if he is the first to use this AP after the insertion of the AP in the network. This is possible due to our threshold K1, which prevents users to connect to an AP which has a trust value lower than the threshold.

downloading from them. EigenTrust gives to each peer a trust value based on its previous behavior. Each peer can ask the opinions of the people they trust and weight their opinions by their trust value. In order to apply EigenTrust some peers will be defined as APs and the remaining peers will be defined as users. EigenTrust allows peers to select the most trustworthy peer to interact with him. In our case, EigenTrust will help users to choose the most trustworthy AP. EigenTrust normalizes the trust value of peers, but EigenTrust does not distinguish between a peer with whom peer i did not interact and a peer with whom peer i has had poor experience. This is one of the weak points of their solution.
Simulation 8 We have 230 users, 230 APs. In the 1000 APs we have 207 APNs and 23 APMs. All APs at the beginning of each simulation have as trust value 0.5

Simulation 7 We have 230 users, 189 APNs, 19 APSs, 46 APMs, K1=0.5 and K2=0.8. All APs at the beginning of each simulation has as trust value 100. In Salem solution APS will change behavior when its trust value will be lower than 50.

Figure 13. Result of Simulation 8
The number of normal users using APMs decreases quickly. At beginning all APs have the same trust value but after the first round the trust value of malicious APs decreases and trust value of APNs increases. Figure 13 shows that EigenTrust helps users to choose trustworthy APs in the situation where we can have malicious and normal APs.

Figure 12. Result of simulation 7
Figure 12 shows how Salem solution deals with APSs and APMs at the same time. Result of simulation 7 shows that Salem solution does not prevent users from connecting to APMs and APSs. But we notice that just few users used APSs and some time the number of users using APs is close to zero. So, Salem solution is not useful from preventing users to use APSs and APMs.
4.4.2 EigenTrust
We compare also our solution with EigenTrust algorithm [10]. EigenTrust algorithm is mostly used on peer-to-peer systems. The goal of EigenTrust algorithm is to identify sources of unauthentic files and bias peers against

Simulation 9 We have 230 users, 230 APMs, K1=0.5 and K2=0.8. All APs at the beginning of each simulation has as trust value 100. All APs at the beginning of each simulation have as trust value 0.5
Figure 14. Result of Simulation 9
Figure 14 shows how EigenTrust solution behaves when there are only malicious APs. Unfortunately, as we can see, EigenTrust cannot prevent users from connecting to APMs when there are only APMs around. Our solution takes care of this case when there are only APMs

available. This is possible due to our threshold K1, which prevents users to connect to an AP which has a trust value lower than the threshold.

Our solution provides a way to select trustworthy APs and to prevent users to use malicious APs by taking into account the presence of malicious APs, malicious users and APs that can change behavior, meaning that a normal AP can become malicious or that a malicious AP can become normal.

5. Conclusion
In conclusion, we can say that our solution helps to promote the selection of trustworthy APs which have a certain degree of confidence and also to prevent users from connecting to malicious APs. Thus, our solution is applicable even in an environment where there are malicious APs. It is also applicable when APs change their behavior and it reduces the number of APs which try to trick users. Comparing our solution with that proposed by Salem for selecting APs and with EigenTrust algorithm, we find that our solution is more robust than the one in Salem et al. because our solution is resistant to attacks such as inserting malicious APs and inserting malicious users. Regarding EigenTrust, our solution can deal with a higher percentage of malicious APs among all APs than Eigentrust.

Abstract One of the important problems in multiprocessor systems is Task Graph Scheduling. Task Graph Scheduling is an NP-Hard problem. Both learning automata and genetic algorithms are search tools which are used for solving many NP-Hard problems. In this paper a new hybrid method based on Genetic Algorithm and Learning Automata is proposed. The proposed algorithm begins with an initial population of randomly generated chromosomes and after some stages, each chromosome maps to an automaton. Experimental results show that superiority of the proposed algorithm over the current approaches. Keywords: Task Graph, Scheduling, Genetic Algorithm, Learning Automata.
1. Introduction
Although computer performance has evolved exponentially in the past, there have always been applications that demand more processing power than a single state-of-the-art processor can provide. To respond to this demand, multiple processing units are employed conjointly to collaborate on the execution of one application. Computer systems that consist of multiple processing units are referred to as parallel systems. In designing parallel systems different aspects have to be taken into consideration such as the manner of dividing a program into some tasks and the manner of tasks assignment to processors which is called Task Graph Scheduling.
Task Graph Scheduling is an important issue in the distribution of programs on the processors of a parallel system. Because task graph scheduling is an NP-Hard problem, methods of random search are utilized for finding the nearly optimal scheduling [1]. Among the

various methods of random search, Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been one of the best ones ever used for Task Graph Scheduling [2-6]. Learning Automata (LA) is another method that is used for Task Graph Scheduling [7-9]. Also other methods are also used for Task Graph Scheduling that we are going to consider some of them in this paper [10-12]. In this paper parallel programs are presented by the Task Graph. Fig. 1 depicts an example of the task graph for a program. The numbers allocated to the graph nodes represent the costs of the completion of that node, and the numbers given to the manes of the graph represent the connection cost among nodes. Each contrastive node is a task.

The connection cost between two nodes is put forward when the instruction of those two nodes are applied in

different processors. If both instructions are running on same processor, in that case, the connection cost between those two instructions is considered zero (in fact reality the connection cost is not zero but very minimal time. Due to the meagerness of this cost, it is considered zero). The rest of the paper will be as follows:

In part two, an outline of the Genetic Algorithm is put forward, afterwards, in part three learning automata is introduced. After that, in part four, the new algorithm for solving the problem of the task graph scheduling is presented and in part five, result of experiments are analyzed and then, in final part conclusions will be investigated.
2. GENETIC ALGORITHM
Genetic Algorithms which act on the basis of evaluation in nature search for the final solution among a population of potential solution. In every generation the fittest of that generation selected and after reproduction produce a new set of children. In this process the fittest individuals will survive more probably to the next generations. At the beginning of algorithm a number of individuals (initial population) are created randomly and the fitness function is evaluated for all of them. If we do not reach to the optimal answer, the next generation is produced with selection of parents based on their fitness and the children mutates with a fixed probability then the new children fitness is calculated and new population is formed by substitution of children with parents and this process is repeated until the conclusion condition is established.
The most advantages of this algorithm compared with common methods are: parallel search instead of serial search, not requiring any additional information such as problem solving method, in-deterministic of algorithm, easy implementation and reaching to several choices. GA uses several operators, each of which have different types and can be implemented using different methods.
3. LEARNING AUTOMATA
Learning in LA is choosing an optimal action from a series of allowable automata actions. This action is applied on a random environment and the environment gives a random answer to this action of automata from a series of allowable answers. The environment's answer depends statistically on automata action. The term environment includes a set of outside conditions and their effect on automata operation. Connection of an automaton

4. The Proposed algorithm
In the proposed algorithm, the combination of genetic algorithm (GA) and learning automata (LA) are used. One of the most important features of the GA is that it has stochastic behavior which is because of the genes too much change. Therefore it is unstable but it has a high speed in creating an approximately appropriate population of chromosomes. The significant feature of LA is its stability because actions or genes don’t change too much. In other words, in each stage of LA rewarding and penalizing are done. While rewarding, a gene strengthens and doesn’t replace. While penalizing, a gene may get weakened or it may be replaced.
The base of proposed algorithm is that, in the first stages, GA be used. By too much change in genes we can reach to an approximately appropriate population of chromosomes. After that to avoid instability and stochastic behavior of GA, the chromosomes are mapped to automata and in order to make it stable, other stages are done by LA. It means in our proposal algorithm the advantage of both method are used.
In details, proposed algorithm mixes GA and LA as follow: First for running genetic algorithm, some chromosomes as initial population are produced. One of these chromosomes is displayed in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3 the genes from left to right indicates first task, second task, … and ninth task. And a random number is assigned to each gene so that the random numbers indicate two concepts:  The priority of tasks. Greater numbers have more
priority.  The number of the processor that is in charge of
running that task. For specifying the number of the processor, we must use the mod of random number to total number of processors.
Second, for running Learning automata each chromosome maps to an automaton. For this propose each gene of

are analyzed. For instance, as shown in Fig. 5 the substring chosen from first chromosome, has a weight order of 1-2-3-4. This weight order is used for changing the substring chosen by second chromosome. Thus, the 613-15-11 is changed to 15-13-11-6. WMX algorithm is not one, which changes only the contents of two points selected from two chromosomes, but it also changes the contents of classes according to weight priorities.

Next, details of genetic algorithm about fitness function, crossover operator, mutation operator and selection operator in my proposed algorithm are described.

In Genetic Algorithm, fitness function determines whether chromosomes are going to stay alive or not. In the problem of task scheduling, the object is to find a short makespan. Eq. (1) Shows Fitness function for evaluation of chromosomes.

Fig. 5 Example of Crossover Operator.

For operating mutation, two genes are randomly selected from a chromosome and their amounts are changed with each other.

Selection operator in this article is as follows: In each step of new population production, a percent of chromosomes, which has least amount of fitness, are selected and enter in the new population directly. The rest of the population is produced through combining chromosomes.

Next details of automata and its operators are described. In this automaton α {α1,...,αk } is the set of allowed action for the learning automata. This automaton has k actions (i.e. the number of the actions of this automaton is equal to number of the tasks of the graph). Each action specifies a special task when and where will be executed. ɸ{ ɸ1 , ɸ2 , ɸ3 ... , ɸ KN } is the set of situations, and N is the memory depth for automata. The situation set of this automaton is divided to k subsets and each task is categorizing to where and which position it is located. In the set of j’s action, position ɸ(j-1)N+1 is called internal

Since, each chromosome is presented as a learning automaton, in each automaton, after considering the fitness of a gene (either processor or action), which is selected on a random basis, that gene is duly penalized or rewarded. As a result of penalizing a gene, its position in the boundary position of an action, leads to a change in its action and, in consequence, creation of a new makespan. Reward action occurs when the fitness of a task is smaller than its threshold. Eq. (2) shows fitness of ti and Eq. (3) shows threshold rate of ti.

ri has a reverse relation with xi; as ri increases xi decreases and vice versa. If the fitness level of a ti task is equal to zero, it means that all related tasks of ti are performed on the same processor. Therefore, the lower value of fitness is better for scheduling problem. In case the fitness level of a task is more than the threshold amount, then the task gets penalized. Two positions are possible when penalizing a task:
a) The task’s value might be in a position other than boundary position. In this case, penalizing makes it less important. How the task’s value of t3 task is penalizes, is shown in Fig. 6.

Fig. 6 t3 task penalizing.
b) The task’s value might be in boundary position. In this case, we look for a task in the graph that has the greatest reduction in the amount of fitness when the values of them are changed. Now if the value of found task is in the boundary position, two values are changed with each other and if otherwise, i.e. if the value of found task is not in the boundary position, first the value of found task should be moved to its boundary position and then values change occurs. Fig. 7 shows how t4 task is penalized.

Abstract
A noise estimation algorithm plays an important role in speech enhancement. Speech enhancement for automatic speaker recognition system, Man–Machine communication, Voice recognition systems, speech coders, Hearing aids, Video conferencing and many applications are related to speech processing. All these systems are real world systems and input available for these systems is only the noisy speech signal, before applying to these systems we have to remove the noise component from noisy speech signal means enhanced speech signal can be applied to these systems. In most speech enhancement algorithms, it is assumed that an estimate of noise spectrum is available. Noise estimate is critical part and it is important for speech enhancement algorithms. If the noise estimate is too low then annoying residual noise will be available and if the noise estimate is too high then speech will get distorted and loss intelligibility. This paper focus on the different approaches of noise estimation. Section I introduction, Section II explains simple approach of Voice activity detector (VAD) for noise estimation, Section III explains different classes of noise estimation algorithms, Section IV explains performance evaluation of noise estimation algorithms, Section V conclusion.

reduce listener’s fatigue, improve the performance of hearing aids¸ cockpit communication¸ videoconferencing¸ speech coders and many other speech processing systems. In most speech enhancement algorithms it is assumed that an estimate of noise spectrum is available. Noise estimate is critical part and it is important for speech enhancement algorithms. Performance of speech enhancement algorithms depends on correct estimation of noise. Simple approach to estimate the noise spectrum of the signal using a Voice Activity Detector (VAD) another approach to estimate the noise using different noise estimation algorithms Noise estimation algorithms that continuously track the noise spectrum. It is challenging task to estimate the noise spectrum even during speech activity hence Researcher developed many noise estimation algorithms which are explained in next section.
2. Voice Activity Detection

1. Introduction
Speech enhancement plays an important role in numerous applications such as hearing aids¸ speech coding¸ cell phones¸ automatic recognition of speech signals by machines and many more. Speech signals from the uncontrolled environment may contain degradation components along with the required speech components. Degradation components include back ground noise¸ reverberation and speech from other speakers. Therefore the degraded speech components need to be processed for the enhancement. Speech enhancement algorithms improve

Simple approach to estimate and update the noise spectrum during the silent segments of the signal using a Voice Activity Detector (VAD). The process of discriminating between the voice activity that is speech presence and silence that is speech absence is called voice activity detection. VAD algorithms typically extract some type of feature (e.g. short time energy, zero crossing etc.) from the input signal and compared against threshold value, usually determined during speech absent period. Generally output of VAD algorithms is binary decision on a frame-by-frame basis having frame duration 20-30 msec. A segment of speech is declared to contain voice activity (VAD = ‘1’) if measured value exceed a predetermined threshold otherwise it is declared a noise (VAD = ‘0’) figure 1shows VAD decisions. Several VAD algorithms

were proposed based on various types of features extracted from the signal. Noise estimation can have major impact on the quality and Intelligibility of speech signal. The early VAD Algorithms

noise level, hence the chosen duration of the analysis segment will result from a track-off between these two restrictions. Now we will see different classes of noise estimation Algorithms.

Figure -1 shows VAD decisions [3]
were based on energy levels and zero crossing [4], Ceptral features [4], the Itakura LPC spectral distance measures and the periodicity measures [2]. Some of VAD Algorithms are used in (GSM) System [3], cellular Networks [3], and digital cordless telephone systems [3]. VAD Algorithms are suitable for discontinues transmission in voice communication systems as they can be used to save the battery life of cellular phones. The majority of the VAD Algorithms encounter problems in low SNR conditions, particularly when the noise is nonstationary [1, 2]. Having an accurate VAD Algorithm in a non-stationary environment might not be sufficient in speech enhancement. Applications, as on accurate noise estimation is required at all times, even during speech activity. In case of Noise estimation algorithms they continuously track the noise spectrum therefore more suited for speech enhancement applications in nonstationary Scenarios.

Figure-2 Plot of noisy speech power spectrum and local minimum [10]
3.1. Minimal – Tracking Algorithms
Minimal Tracking Algorithms are based on the assumption that the power of the noisy speech signal in individual frequency bands often decays to the power level of the noise, even during speech activity [12]. Hence by tracking the minimum of the noisy speech power in each frequency band, one can get a rough estimate of the noise level in that band. Two different algorithms were proposed for noise estimation first minimum statistics (MS) on noise estimation, which tracks the minimum of the noisy speech power spectrum within a finite window that is in analysis segment, and 2nd algorithm tracks the minimum continuously without requiring a window are explained in next section. Plot of noisy speech power spectrum and local minimum using (3) for a speech degraded by babble noise at 5dB SNR at frequency bin k=6 is shown in figure 2.

3. Classes of Noise Estimation Algorithms
There are three classes of noise estimation algorithms. Minimal tracking Algorithms, Time Recursive Algorithms and Histogram based Algorithms. All algorithms operate in the following fashion. First the signal is analyzed using short time spectra computed from short overlapping frames, typically 20-30 msec. Windows with 50% overlap between adjacent frames. Then several consecutive frames called analysis segment are used in the computation of the noise spectrum. Typical time span of this segment may range from 400 msec. to 1 sec. The noise estimation algorithms are based on the assumptions that the analysis segment is too long enough to contain speech pauses and low energy signals segments and the noise present in the analysis segment is more stationary than speech, new assumption is that noise changes at a relatively slower rate than speech. The analysis segment has to be long enough to encompass speech pauses and low energy segments, but it also has to be short enough to track fast changes in the

3.1.1. Minimum statistics (MS) Noise Estimation

The Minimum Statistics algorithm was originally proposed by Martin R. (1994) and later refined in [5] to include a bias compensation factor and better smoothing factor. Let y(n) = x(n) + d(n) denote the noise speech signal, where x(n) is the clean speech signal and d(n) is the noise signal, assume that x(n) and d(n) are statistically independent and zero mean. Noisy speech signal is transformed in the frequency domain by first applying a window w(n) to M samples of y(n) and then computing the M-point FFT of the windowed signal.

Y(λ, k) = y (λM + m) w(m) e-j2πmk/M

(1)

Where λ indicates the frame index and k the frequency bin index varient from k = 0, 1, 2 ... M-1. Y(λ, k) is the short term Fourier Transform (STFT) of y(n). Periodogram of the noisy speech is approximately equal to the sum of periodogram of clean speech and noise given as

| Y (λ, k) |² ≈ | X (λ, k)|² + |D(λ, k)|2

(2)

Where |Y(λ, k)|² is the periodogram of noisy speed signal,

|X (λ, k)|² is the periodogram of clean speed signal and

|D(λ, k) |² is the periodogram of Noise signal. Because of

this assumption, we can estimate the noise power spectrum

by tracking the minimum of the periodogram |Y(λ, k) |² of

the noisy speech over a fixed window length. The

periodogram |Y(λ, k)|² fluctuates very rapidly over time,

hence 1st under recursive version of periodogram can be

used as

P (λ, k) = α P (λ – 1, k) + (1-α) |Y (λ, k) |²

(3)

Where α is the smoothing constant. The above recursive equation in recognized as an IIR Low pass filter, provides a smoothed version of periodogram |Y(λ, k)|². We can obtain an estimate of the power spectrum of the noise by tracking the minimum of P(λ,k).Our finite window smoothing constant α chosen experimentally not too low or too high. There are two main issues with the spectral minimal – tracking approach the existence of a bias in the noise estimate and the possible overestimate of the noise level because of inappropriate choice of the smoothing constant. More accurate noise estimation algorithm can be developed by deriving a bias factor to compensate for the lower noise values and by incorporating a smoothing constant that is not fixed but varies with time and frequency. The noise estimation algorithm using MS is summarized as below [12]. For each frame λ do following steps
1. Compute the short-term periodogram |Y(λ, k)|² of the noisy speech frame.
2. Compute the smoothing parameter α (λ, k) using equation.

3. Compute the smoothed power spectrum P (λ, k) using equation( 3).

3.1.2 Continuous Spectral Minimum

One of the drawbacks of the minimal tracking employed in the MS algorithm is its inability to respond to fast changes of the noise spectrum [12]. A different method for tracking the spectral minima was proposed in [10]. In contrast to using a fixed window for tracking the minimum of noisy speech is in [5] the noise estimate is updated continuously by smoothing the noisy speech power spectra in each frequency bin using a non-linear smoothing rule. For minimum tracking of the noisy speech power spectrum, a short time smoothed version of the periodogram of noisy speech is computed as before using the equation (3) and α is smoothing factor (0.7 < α < 0.9). The non-linear rule used for estimating the noise spectrum based on tracking the minimum of the noisy speech power (Pmin (λ, k)) in each frequency bin as follows

If Pmin (λ-1, k) < P (λ, k) then

Where Pmin (λ, k) is the noise estimate and the parameter nocks set to α = 0.7, Po = 0.96 and γ = 0.998 [10], β is the look-ahead factor in minimum tracking, which can be adjusted if needed to vary the adaptation time of the algorithm. The typical adaption time using the values mentioned is 0.2–0.4msec figure 3 Shows exchange of continuous minimum tracking based in equation (4). The nonlinear tracking, maintains continuous psd smoothing without making any distinction between speech absent or present segments. Hence the noise estimation increases

whenever the noisy speech power spectrum increases, irrespective of the changes in the noise power level.
3.2 Time Recursive Averaging for Noise Estimation

The time–recursive averaging Algorithms exploit the

observation that the noise signal typically has non uniform

effect on the spectrum of speech [12], in that some regions

of the spectrum will typically have a different effective

signal to noise ratio (SNR). As a result, different from

bands in the spectrum will have effectively different SNRs.

More generally, for any type of noise we can estimate and

update individual frequency bands of the noise spectrum

whenever the probability of speech being absent at a

particular frequency band is high or whenever the

effective SNR at a particular frequency band is extremely

low. This observation led to the recursive arranging type 3. of algorithms in which noise spectrum is estimated as a

weighted average of past noise estimates and the present

noisy speech spectrum. The weights change adaptively

depending either on the effective SNR of each frequency

bin or on the speech present probability. All types of time

recursive algorithms have following the general form as

follows

๔d² (λ – 1) = α (λ, k) ๔d² (λ – 1, k) +

5.

(1 – α(λ, k)) |Y (λ, k) |²

(5)

Where |Y(λ, k)|² is the periodogram of noisy speech, ๔d² ( λ, k) denotes the estimate of the noise psd at frame λ, and frequency k and α(λ, k)is the smoothing factor, which is timed and frequency dependent. Different algorithms were developed depending on the selection of the smoothing factor α (λ, k). Some chose to compute α(λ, k) based on the estimated SNR of each frequency bin [10] where as others chose to compute α (λ, k) based on the probability of speech being present or absent at frequency bin k [6]. Minima controlled Recursive Averaging (MCRA) Algorithm is based on this approach which is explained in next section. These two approaches are conceptually very similar. Other chose to use a fixed value for α (λ, k) only after a certain condition was met [6, 7].

3.2.1 Minima Controlled Recursive Averaging (MCRA) Algorithm
According to method explained in [6], the conditional speech presence probability P^(λ, k) is computed by comparing the ratio of the noisy speech power spectrum to its local minimum against a threshold value. The probability estimate P^ (λ, k) and the time smoothing factor α (λ, k), is controlled by the estimate of spectral

minimum and due to this reason this algorithm is called as Minima Controlled Recursive Averaging Algorithm (MCRA). This Algorithm is modified by researchers and some of them are MCRA-2 Algorithm explained in [7], improved MCRA Algorithm explained in [8]. The MCRA noise estimation algorithm proposed by Cohen in [6] is summarized [12] as

1. Smooth noisy psd S(λ, k) as follows

S (λ, k) = αs S (λ – 1,k) + (1 – αs)| Y (λ, k)| ² (6)

Where αs is smoothing constant.

2. Perform minimal tracking on S(λ,k) using equation (4) to obtain Smin (λ, k)

3. Determine P(λ, k) using equation(7)

If S (λ, k) > δ (threshold)

P^ (λ, k) = 1 speech present

else

(7)

P^ (λ, k) = 0 speech absent

end.

4. Compute the time-frequency dependent smoothing

factor αd (λ, k) using equation (8) and the smoothed

Conditional probability P̂(λ, k) from equation (9).

αd (λ, k) = α + (1-α) p (λ, k)

(8)

P^(λ, k) = α p^(λ-1, k) + (1-αp) p^ (λ, k) (9)

5. Update the noise psd ๔d² (λ, k) using equation (10)

๔d² (λ,k)= αd (λ, k)๔d²(λ-1,k) + [1-αd (λ, k)]|Y (λ, k)]|² (10)

3.3 Histogram – Based Noise estimation algorithms

In a general mathematical sense, a histogram is a function that counts the number of observations that fall into each of the disjoint categories known as bins, whereas the graph of a histogram is merely one way to represent a histogram as shown in figure-4. Histogram based noise estimation algorithms are motivated by the observation that the Most frequent value (that is the Histogram maximum) of energy values in individual frequency bands corresponds to the noise level of the specified frequency band, that is the noise level corresponds to the maximum of the histogram of energy values. In some cases, the histogram of spectral energy values may contain two modes lst a low energy mode corresponding to the speech absent and low energy segments of speech and 2nd a high energy mode corresponding to the (noisy) voiced

segments of speech. The noise estimate is obtained based on the histogram of part power spectrum values [11] that is for each in coming frame, 1st construct the histogram of power spectrum

Where ๔d² (λ, k) is the smoothed estimate of the noise psd and αm is a smoothing constant. Various histogram based methods are proposed in [12]

4. Performance Evaluation

Figure-4 shows histogram of signal
values spanning a window of several hundreds of milliseconds and take as an estimate of the noise spectrum the value corresponding to the Maximum of the histogram values. This is done separately for each individual frequency bin. The histogram based noise estimation is summarized [12] as follows
1. Compute the noisy speech power spectrum |Y(λ, k) |².
2. Smooth the noisy psd using 1st order recursion.
S(λ,k) = αS(λ–1, k) +(1 – α)| Y(λ, k) |² (11)
Where α is smoothing constant.
3. Compute the histogram of D part psd estimates
S(λ, k) & S (λ-1, k) S (λ-2, k), --------- S (λ-D, k)
using say 40 bins
4. Let C = [C1, C2, ---- C40] be the counts in each of the 40 bins in the histogram and
S = [S1, S2, ------ S40] denote the corresponding centers of the histogram bins.
5. Let Cmax be the index of the Maximum Count Cmax = arg Max Ci and I varies < i < 40. Then take an estimate of the noise psd denoted by Hmax (λ, k) the value corresponding to the maximum of the histogram
Hmax (λ, k) = S( Cmax).
6. Smooth the noise estimate Hmax (λ, k) using 1st order recursion
๔d²(λ, k) = αm๔d² (λ-1, k)+(1–αm) Hmax(λ, k) (12)

The performance of the noise estimation algorithms was assessed using both objective and subjective measures [10]. In objective evaluation[5] the percentage relative estimation error variance were calculated between the true noise spectrum and estimated noise spectrum for white Gaussian noise, vehicular noise, and street noise, using sentences embedded in 15-dB SNR[8]. Results indicated mean errors on the order of a few percent for the white and vehicular noises and a larger error was noted for street noise, which is highly non-stationary in nature. The performance of MS Algorithm was compared with VAD algorithm [6]. Formal listening tests were conducted to evaluate the quality and intelligibility of the enhanced and coded speech. When compared with VAD algorithm, the MS algorithm approach yielded better quality and improved speech intelligibility scores [8]. The tracking of minimum in each frequency bin helped to preserve the weak voiced consonants, which might be classified as noise by most VAD algorithms on their energy is concentrated in a small number of frequency bins that is at low frequencies. Evaluation of the continuous Spectral Minimum Tracking algorithm with minimal tracking algorithm was reported in [7,8] when compared with Continuous Spectral Minimum Tracking algorithm was found to perform better in terms of both objective and subjective measures. Objective and subjective listening calculations of the MCRA–2 algorithm were reported in [10] when MCRA-2 algorithm was integrated in a speechenhancement algorithm [10] and compared using subjective preference tests against other noise estimation algorithms including MS and MCRA. Subjective evaluation indicated that the speech quality of the MCRA– 2 algorithm was better than MCRA and MS algorithm. Histogram based methods are not evaluated with MS, MCRA and other methods.
4. Conclusions
VAD Algorithms are not well suited for non-stationary environment. Noise estimation algorithms estimate and update the noise spectrum continuously, even during speech activity. Noise estimation algorithms are more suited for speech enhancement algorithms operating in highly non-stationary environments. Three different classes of noise estimation algorithms were presented.

Most of the noise estimation algorithms described provide an underestimate of noise the noise spectrum and are not able to respond fast enough to increasing noise levels. Objective evaluation and comparison between various noise estimation algorithms was also presented. Depending on the application one has to select noise estimation algorithm.

Abstract
Concern about the privacy of personal information and communications is the top reason many consumers have stayed out off the online services including mobile phone services. The keen competitive in the communication and mobile phone service market place and the increasing numbers of mobile phone users all over the world has influence the researcher to investigate privacy as antecedents of customer loyalty in mobile phone services industry. Out of 800 questionnaires distributed, four hundreds and eighty eight set of questionnaires have returned and analyzed. The analysis shows that privacy was positively significant towards customer loyalty. Base on the results, it can be concluded that the mobile service provider has to ensure their services fully satisfied their customer privacy. Somehow, future research must investigate other factors as the antecedent for loyalty. Other initiative is to consider a model testing in difference context of electronic service to see any generalization on the research result.
Keywords: Privacy, loyalty, mobile services, Jordan.

1. Introduction
Communication industry is gaining popularity and importance in many advanced and developing countries. Today, communication is becoming the nerve of the life. Mobile usage is growing rapidly, and telecommunication marketers are developing new strategies to take advantage of the potential customers. According to Federal Communications Commission (2003), subscribers for mobile telephony services in the United States for 2002 stood at 141.8 million. Literature also shows that 7.5% of all mobile phone subscribers actually use the phones to browse the Internet. On the other hand, an estimated 11.9 million in the U.S. subscribe to mobile Internet service [2]. It has been estimated that in 2003 there were 1.4 billion mobile phones worldwide, half of them capable of being

internet-enabled (Clarke III, 2001). Communication devices for both entertainment and commerce, corporations are also increasing considering cell phones as a critical success factor to conducting business activities [3]. Recently, customers can go to market with the “mobility” that new technology has brought to customers’ daily lives. Usage of mobile phones has now extended from voice communications to the internet, increase in extension of mobile internet technology and much development of m-commerce applications has opened great opportunity for mobile service users. However, surveys on US consumers’ perceptions of mobile service show that the level of satisfaction is much lower for mobile service carriers compared to other service sectors [4]. Mobile service carriers need to be aware of drivers of customer satisfaction and loyalty in order to build effective business strategies for customer retention [5].
The objective of service companies that offers communication services is to develop services which satisfy the customers. In due time, satisfied customers will be those that will be loyal and help the company to sustain business. It is important to understand that in order to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty [6] which consequently increases a steady stream of revenue, customer equity and market share [7] service providers have to sustain a share of each customer to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. The drastic changes in the environment forced financial institutions to revise their marketing strategies and stress long-lasting relationships with customers [8]. Due to the many alternatives available to the customer, customers ease to switch service provider to any other competitors. Consequently, mobile phone service providers are losing 2-4 percent of their subscribers monthly; disloyal customers can amount to

millions of lost revenue and profit. Aydin and Ozer (2005), for instance indicated that; increasing customer retention (or customer loyalty) by 5 percent could lead to 25-75 percent profit growth [10].
Generally, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of privacy on customer loyalty. The context of this study is mobile telecommunication industry.
2. Literature Review
2.1 Customer Loyalty
In today’s competitive and changeable market place, customer loyalty is seen to be critical factor to the success of business organizations because attracting new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones [11]. Many authors suggested that loyal customers are a competitive asset and that a way of increasing customer retention is through secure and collaborative relationship between buyers and sellers [12]. Loyalty becomes a critical concept in the marketplace. Today, a number of studies have attempted to define the loyalty, researchers have used both attitudinal and behavioural measures to define and assess customer loyalty [13]. From an attitudinal perspective consumer loyalty is a specific desire to continue a relationship with suppliers and provider [14]. Oliver, (1997) defines customer loyalty as “A deeply held commitment to re-buy or re-patronize a preferred product/ service consistently in the future.” According to Dimitriades, (2006) ‘‘loyal’’ are defined those customers who hold favourable attitudes toward an organization, recommend the organization to other consumers and exhibit repurchase behaviour.
Customers will be emotionally loyal when they feel appreciated: recognized by the first name, capable to chat with customer service and take pleasure in the experience of dealing with the company, the emotional or attitudinal preferences precede loyal behaviours [17]. Marketing literature propose that customer loyalty can be defined in two different ways which is related to individual’s degree of loyalty toward product or service and behavioural loyalty which is related to continuing purchase services from the same supplier [18].
There are two types of measures for customer loyalty, which include both attitudinal and behavioural. Attitudinal measures can be seen in the intent to repurchase, willingness to recommend providing the basis for developing leading indicators of customer loyalty and behavioural measures such as; repeating purchasing,

volume or frequency of purchasing, returns, debt, complaints and interactions, customer retention and longevity [19].
The accurate measures of customer loyalty are hard to determine because it can be measured in many ways. Researchers have used either attitudinal or behavioral measures [13]. The assumption made under attitude measurement is that a variety of important feeling generate an individual’s overall attachment to a product or service and the company which in turn defines the individual degree of loyalty. The second is behavioral; under this method customer, loyalty can be measured as continuous purchase, frequent purchase, scope of a relationship, recommendations make to other people, friends and customers [20].
There are three characteristic approaches to measure loyalty: behavioral measurements; attitudinal measurement; and composite measurements [21]. The behavioral measurements consider repurchase as an indicator of loyalty, attitudinal measurements use attitudinal data to reflect the emotional and psychological attachment underlying in loyalty, composite measurements combine the two dimensions and measure loyalty by customers' product preferences, tendency of brand switching, repurchase, and amount of purchase [22]. Furthermore, differentiate between true loyalty and bogus loyalty is important. Many studies have proposed that true loyalty covers a non-random behavioral response as a result from evaluation processes consequence in commitment [23].
Loyalty program is important in attracting and retaining customers. Marketers have invested great amount of their resources to develop loyalty programs. Capizzi and Ferguson, (2005) conducted a study to investigate the effectiveness of loyalty marketing in practice; they suggested that a well-designed loyalty program with strong value propositions is the key factor of successful loyalty marketing. Another Study by Go´mez et al., (2006 ) investigate the behavioral and affective loyalty of retailer customers in order to establish the role played by loyalty programs and the effect of loyalty programs on customer loyalty. They found that participants in loyalty programs are more behavioral and affectively loyal than non-participants. However, most customers after joining a loyalty program do not change purchase behavior. To develop an effective loyalty program, it is important to understand the process of customers’ loyalty decisions as the customer needs and value propositions vary across different types of service and products. Evidently, it is becoming clear that loyalty program played significant

role to achieving true customer loyalty and enhancing profitability.
Today, marketers and managers have shifted their stress and focus to their customer’s loyalty. Recent trend in marketing is to create attractive and lasting experiences for the customers in attempt to create total loyalty. Mascarenhas et al., (2006) conducted a research to review the concepts of total customer experience and lasting customer loyalty in order to sustain lasting customer loyalty. They found that total customer experience is captured in three important interactive factors: physical moments, emotional involvement moments, and its value chain moments. Therefore, a typology of customer loyalties is proposed as a function of high versus low levels of the three constitutive factors of total customer experience.
This paper investigates the influence of privacy on customer loyalty. Even though Taylor and Hunter (2002) indicated that customer loyalty is influenced by customer satisfaction, while Yang and Peterson, (2004) found that e-satisfaction exhibits a positive impact on e-loyalty and important factor for a long-term relationship between a customer and service provider. The next paragraphs discuss more about privacy and then it provided some justification why privacy was chosen as one of the antecedent of loyalty especially in online service environment.
2.2 Customer Privacy
The factor had been chosen as antecedent variable in the present study is customer privacy. Privacy has been used to indicate a wide number of interests including personal information control, reproductive autonomy, access to places and bodies, secrecy, and personal development. Privacy interests also appear to be culturally relative – for instance , in some culture opening a door without knocking might be considered a serious privacy violation and yet permitted in another, that’s mean culture some time can effect privacy [29]. Privacy has long been defined as the right of a person to be left alone and to be able to have control over the flow and disclosure of information about him or herself [30]. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been evaluating the online marketplace and has identified privacy as a key issue that Internet marketers need to recognize and address [32]. Generally, Consumer privacy identified as a "significant marketing issue of the 9O's" [33].
Concerns about privacy are not new. It has often surface because new information technologies and information systems have improved the collection, storage, use, and

sharing of personal information [34]. In the wide world web, internet environment and online services, consumers became very concerned about the privacy and security of their personal information and looking for greater protections. Concern about the privacy of personal information and communications is the top reason many consumers have stayed out off the Internet [35]. Online users have to learn as much as possible how to protect their privacy and the possible threats of using the services, mobile phone users are not exempted.
People logging on to the Internet and online services are on the rise. The Internet and online browsers activities are bringing new threats to personal privacy. Customer activities, whether passive or active, can provide company a great deal of information about customer [36]. It is clearly that information security and privacy is the most critical problem faces by online service users. Past study found that the customers have very strong views about protecting their privacy on the online services; companies must protect their consumers’ information and privacy [36]. Furthermore, they suggest that consumer’s behaviours about online services are depended on many factors, privacy is one of them.
The Internet consists of a huge number of linked computers carrying many information and data. When the customer access to the Internet he is opened for various threat and may lose vital data [36]. Nowadays databases are becoming accessible from the Internet and search engine make it quite easy and accessible. The threat of long-term storage and revelation of personal and private information is significant issue over internet world [37]. Today, the internet has developed dramatically especially with respect to its use as a tool for communication, entertainment, and marketplace trading [38]. This growth has been a great concern particularly to do with the collection and distribution of data online. These concerns relate to the customer privacy not only over the internet but also mobile phone users.
The nature of interactivity process generates opportunities and challenges for online marketers and researchers. Sheehan and Hoy, (2000) indicated that online privacy concerns are more complex than concerns in the traditional marketing communication. Marketers have to translate their customer’s wants and needs into effective communication strategies and understand consumer privacy concerns and address these concerns in their marketing communications. They have to understand customer concerns with privacy and information gathering and use their knowledge and expertise to build a confident customer base online to reach online commerce

successfully and enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.
When the customer feel the information is used only for the major purpose of transaction, consumers normally become unconcerned about privacy. Nevertheless, if marketers use information beyond the original transaction, consumers become more concerned with privacy [39]. Privacy becomes a matter of concern when customers are feeling that information about them is being collected without their permission, or they do not know how the information is being used specifically. A great challenge for marketers in the online environment is to build trustworthy relationships with online users. It should be clear to what extent customer privacy should be protected. Four basic rules considered. Namely, the customer should be notified their personal information is collected and will be used for specific purposes, the customer should be able to decline to be tracked, the customer should be allowed to access their information and correct it, and customer data should be protected from unauthorized usage [40].
Protecting customer privacy on web is a critical issue since customer accessing to an electronic product catalogue, is required to identify him during the purchase and service phases to ensure customer privacy. Elovici et al., (2005) proposed solution for customer privacy including the following advantages: All privacy components enhancing mechanism are under the customer control completely. Consequently, the customers do not need to depend on not a trustworthy provider. Second, the solution allows customer to protect his or her privacy without remaining unknown. This is required for commercial transaction concerning products and services delivery.
Companies have to understand how to reach an appropriate balance between developing customer insight and maintaining the customer's privacy, and how to manage their customer individual privacy. Companies must make every effort to deliver more-effective post-sale interactions with their customer evidently, customer information privacy is also a important consideration for customer service [42]). Unfortunately, companies sometimes use customers information's without customer agreement leading to bad feelings on the part of their customers since this violation is a customer privacy violation. Customers can provide important data about themselves to the company but the company has to know how to handle their data when it comes to Privacy [42].

feel secure while interacting with e-business. This lack of trust may in turn affect the customer’s overall relationship with E-business. Privacy is an important issue in traditional communication and online environment; therefore it is important factors to be considered in customer decision to loyal toward the online services.
Based on the above literature we notice that privacy is a significant important factor influencing e-businesses and e commerce acceptance. Therefore, there is a relationship between customer privacy and service loyalty. This research proposes customer privacy as one of antecedents of customer loyalty in mobile phones services. This paper explores the important of privacy on customer loyalty in mobile phone services in Jordan.
3. Methodology
3.1 Samples for the study
University students are selected as the respondents for this research. In this research, students were chosen as the study samples for several reasons. Firstly, using university students for this study was appropriate because this group is an important target market for mobile phone services providers [44]. The students represent professional users who handle typical mobile phone service activity such as SMS, chatting, games and other services [45]. Furthermore, in a recent study of mobile phone usage, consumers in the 18-24 year age group used mobile phones 71% more than the average for all age groups [46]. A stratified sampling was used to select approximately equal numbers of customers from each university. 800 questionnaires distributed to five universities in the northern, southern and central states of Jordan. 488 questionnaires returned and analysis. This brings the response rate of around 57 percent. All items were adopted from previous researches. Each of the items was accompanied by five -point response format, ranging from 5 =strongly agree to 1 = strongly disagree. Before the actual research, a pilot study was conducted to investigate the reliability and validity of the items, which are mostly adopted from the previous research early responses are compared to late responses [47]. According to a t-test analysis, these two groups of respondents had no significant differences across all of the variables. Accordingly, it seems that non-response bias did not appear to be a significant problem.

According to the study by Horn et al., (2005) in addition to personalization, privacy is another value added feature that an e-business can utilize to enhance customer relationships. Without privacy, customers may not trust or

3.2 Measurement

4. Result and Discussions

4.1 Correlation Analysis

Pearson correlation was used to describe the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables [48]. The values of the correlation coefficients (r) given in the table 2 indicate the strength of the relationship between variables. The computation of the person correlation coefficient was performed to obtain an understanding of the relationship between all variables in the study. The value of the correlation coefficients (r) indicates the strength of the relationship between the variables. According to Tabachnick and Fidell, (1996) and Pallant, (2001) the correlation between predictor and dependent variables must be below 0.7. If the score is more than 0.7, the variables must be deleted from the study. On the other hand, perceived privacy is statistically correlated with customer loyalty with correlation values at 0.553 as shown in the table below.

5.0 Research Contribution and Limitation
The contribution of this research from the theoretical perspective lies in identifying multiple ways through which privacy impact customer loyalty, principally in the context of mobile phone service in Jordan. The present study contributes to the literature by investigating the issue of customer loyalty within the context of mobile phone service subscribers who are directly experience using the services. Since subscribers have direct experience in using services, it is logical if we choose them to determine their loyalty in the services. This study helps to build theory concerning customer intention to stay with service providers longer, deeper and build long lasting relationship with mobile phone service providers. This study constructed loyalty as adoption behaviour that is similar to the concept of actual usage in the Technology Acceptance Model [50].
The results of this study give several implications for mobile service providers and marketing managers with regard to how to plan and market services that will be considered valuable by customers and used in the future. Furthermore, the present study considered as important grounds for formulating and implementing privacy strategies in assessing service providers to assign proportionate amount of resources to achieve sustainable customer loyalty. In addition, results of this research will also go a long way in minimizing the observed inconsistency between; the service provider strategy and customers perspective, which enable service providers to

compare their customer perception of their offering strategy in relation to other providers.
However there is some limitation of this research. From a methodological point of view, data in this research were obtained from university students in the selected universities. It would be useful to obtain a broader sample of respondents in the future studies. This would minimize any potential bias in the data resulting from the level of the informants. While student subjects have been found to be appropriate for theory testing [51], the findings of this study should be tested on other populations of interest to marketers. While it is likely that relationships are important to customers in a variety of target markets and scenarios, each situation is unique and should be examined carefully. In addition to the limited sampling framework, another limitation is associated with the use of selfcompletion survey methods. Even though survey research is the most widely used approach in the world [52], there are a number of problems associated with this approach. The lack of researcher control in self-completion process necessitates that the resultant data sample will not be fully representative of the population as valid respondents may choose not to complete the survey. In addition, respondents sometimes give expected answers or pattern responses to questions.
6.0 Conclusions
This study found privacy that one of the determinants of customer loyalty. Therefore, students use the mobile phone for other purposes such as making and receiving calls, SMS service, discussing studying issues by concerning on privacy. Concerning the factor that influencing customer loyalty, the present research suggests that privacy as an important determinants. Mobile phone service providers should strive on it to improve performance in their efforts to attain higher level of customer loyalty. The current study finding provides beneficial implications for both academic research and practitioners based on an insightful review of the existing work on some of the antecedents of loyalty. However, since there are so many other factors that might influence customer loyalty besides the chosen factors, it would be useful and practical if they modelled and tested in an integrated framework and expanding the framework across industries and integrating more important factor that may influence loyalty.

Abstract
Multi-criteria decision analysis provides an effective and valuable method of articulating and structuring deliberations within public participation. Public participation means that citizens are involved in the public decision making that has an effect on them. In order to encourage participation while integrating the deliberative perspectives from various participants in public sector, we should support the participatory public decision making process. Our effort is oriented towards integrating trust-based multi-agent modeling within multi-criteria group decision support systems. Decision makers are modeled as agents and each agent has a role in decision making processes which identified by trust level. In this paper, we propose a framework and model to enhance the success of participation process in participatory public decision making. A simple example is also presented in this paper to give a clarity how the framework and model can be implemented in the real situation.
Keywords: Group Decision Making, Participation, MCDA,
Trust, Supra Decision Maker.
1. Introduction
Public decision making is usually tied with a high degree of complexity because of the scarce resources to be allocated and the conflicting interests, e.g. when beneficiaries and bearers of the costs are not equivalent. On the other hand, public concern of the state of the public sector has grown rapidly and this has also increased interest in participatory decision making [9]. Consequently, public approval has become an important decision objective, and the public participation has become a common element in decision making processes. However, the large number of stakeholders also induces a large number of conflicting views, therefore transparent and structured processes are needed to reach participants’ shared understanding of the problem. Another problem in participatory decision making, public as decision makers

consist of various background, knowledge, and interest (e.g. participants are not only experts but also citizen with lack of knowledge and or limited experience in making judgments and decisions) [12] [32].
The main objective of this paper is to overcome problems in participatory public decision making by providing structured and transparent mechanisms. This paper proposes framework and model which integrated structured mechanism using Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and transparent mechanism with trust algorithm. We argue that the framework and model provide ways to systematically structure and support learning process in group decision making (e.g. via interaction between regular/ novice decision maker and expert decision maker), thus it will increase the quality of participatory decision making processes under multicriteria constraints.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: section 2 describes the characteristics of group decision making in the public sector, some related works in public decision making, and several aspects constitute the success of participation process in public decision making. Section 3 discusses MCDA and trust concept as methodology approaches in our model. Section 4 presents our proposed participatory public decision making framework and model. We also extend the framework into participatory decision support systems model and trust model. The illustration of overall framework is provided in section 5. Section 6 presents conclusions and directions for our future work.

2. Participatory Public Decision Making
2.1 The Perspective of Public Decision Making
The public sector problems (e.g. public health, environmental, natural resource, public transportation, local budgeting allocation) are typically complex and disorganized [9]. There may be high risks involved and/or lack of scientific agreement on the cause of problems. The problems also may be ill defined, and the goals may not be clear [14]. In addition, numerous decision makers as stakeholders are often involved in the public sector planning having different and even conflicting views [12]. The stakeholders are defined to be “any group or individual who can affect, or is affected by, the achievement of a corporation’s purpose” [14]. They could be persons like local population, or stakeholder groups such as organizations concerned with related public issues, rural communities, associations related to public issues. Each of them can have different objectives concerning the public issues, which further complicates the evaluation.
Most of the related works in public decision making employs decision analytic methodologies (e.g. MCDA, AHP) or decision support systems (e.g. Web HIPRE) to deal with those problems ([2][20][21] [23] [24] [25] [29]). Author in [20] propose a decision making framework in environmental problem using MCDA. MCDA also utilized in decision making process for the national teacher’s payment scheme in Lithuania [24]; optimization of solar energy use in large building [2]; forestry management [29]. Author in [21] argue that AHP, one of MCDA’s techniques, is suitable for participatory decision making. AHP is employed in forest planning and management decision making [21], budget determination procedure for public building construction process [17].
Author in [23] applies Integrated Methodological Approach, as a participatory multi-criteria decision support, to solve a problem in water allocation. Mustajoki et al. [25] utilized web-based multi-criteria decision support software, called Web-HIPRE, to deal with the evaluation of regulation policies in Finland. Other tools such as: CBA (cost-benefit analysis), CEA (costeffectiveness analysis) also have been utilized in public matters ([9] [23]). All of them provide an entire decisionmaking framework from problem definition over valuation of decision alternatives to ranking/comparing alternatives even though the underlying methodology is different.
Grimmelijkhuisen [10] mentions two perspectives on public decision making: the rational perspective, and bounded rationality perspective. All of those works mentioned above, assume that a decision making process

is a rational and calculative individual, which is called as the rational perspective. It is an assumption borrowed from rational choice theories (e.g. Homans, 1961; Blau, 1964; cited in [9]), which tries to simplify decision making process by listing all values, weighing them and calculate to find the solution of a problem. The rational perspective is a traditional view on public decision-making [10].

In spite of numerous use of rationality perspective, we agree with [10] and [36] that rational perspective ignores the political process of public decision-making and the bounded rationality of individuals. The bounded rationality is another perspective on public decision making that has different scientific approach which adopts an explicitly behavioral attitude rather than making assumptions about decision making and modeling the implications mathematically for aggregate behavior (as in markets or legislatures) [13]. Therefore it takes into account the cognitive limitations of decision makers in attempting to achieve those goals. Therefore, we believe that public decision making should consider individual’s constraints in making judgments and decisions. Due to our literature surveys, there are limited works (e.g. [3] [15]) in public decision making which utilize other mechanisms than decision analytic methodologies to deal with bounded rationality view. Kim [15] proposes a framework for group support systems in e-democracy domain using Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), considering negotiation process among decision makers. Bencina [3] applies trust value in linguistic variables and maps them into fuzzy number to assess the suitability of the project in public sector. Bencina [3] also states that successful implementation of decision support systems in the public sector, with engagement over the whole spectrum of decision making, is still unmet. This is due to public sector specific features compare to private sector. Therefore, we must take into consideration of the specific needs and demands of the public sector for the development of decision support systems for the public sector. Table 1 below presents the comparison of decision making processes in the public and private sector.

2.2 Participation and Group Decision Making
There are occasions where direct participation is claimed as necessary, first and foremost because it can effectively serve to represent people's preferences, which is the ultimate goal the democratic system is aiming at [9]. This grants the public more influence on the decisions, and improves the final decision makers with better understanding of the preferences of the governed people. As Renn 1993 in [9] emphasizes “the functioning of public involvement is therefore contingent on the approval of the technique or model of participation”.

Participation inevitably means that we are discussing a group decision context; and the paradoxes and impossibilities that abound in group decision making and democratic systems are well known ([7] [27]). Group decision making in public sector is expected since it has impact and benefit to its stakeholder. Group decisions are quite more complex compared to single decision making, since a number of contradicting factors are involved such as individuals’ personal opinions, goals and stakes resulting in a social procedure, where negotiation and strategy plays a critical role. Despite the inherent complexity within a group, members are able to express personal opinions and suggest solutions from a personal perspective increasing as well as decision quality.

French et al. [8] discuss several group decision making (GDM) models, i.e.:  GDM 1. Obtain each group member’s subjective
probabilities and utilities, combine the individual probabilities and utilities into group probabilities and utilities, and choose according to their ranking.  GDM 2. Work with each individual and develop a personal decision analysis to guide their choice. Each individual votes within the group and a group choice is made according to the vote.  GDM 3. A supra decision maker (SDM) is imagined to exist. SDM observes the entire elicitation and decision analysis process for each individual and altruistically uses this knowledge to construct a single decision analysis for the group. The choice is made according to the SDM’s analysis.  GDM 4. Gather the group together in a facilitated discussion of the issues. Through discussion between the members, seek to agree on group probabilities and utilities without formally eliciting individual ones. Develop a group analysis and explore the areas of disagreement and seek to reach a decision by consensus without formal voting.  GDM 5. Involves the theories of bargaining, negotiation and, perhaps, arbitration are deployed to define a process in which the group interacts and discusses a series of solutions, usually generated to converge to a point on the Pareto boundary which corresponds to a policy which they all can accept.
Most of the related works in public decision making implement GDM 1 with support of decision analytic methodologies (e.g. MCDA, AHP), as discussed in section 2.1 above. GDM 2 is utilized in e-Participatory Budgeting case in Brazil by allowing citizens to vote to their individual choice [26]. Kim [15] adopt combination of GDM 5 and GDM 1 approaches in his decision making model. Yet, GDM 3 and GDM 4 implementation in public sector are still rarely to be obtained in our literatures review.
We integrate GDM 1 and GDM 3 as our approach to develop framework and model in participatory public decision making. We utilize GDM 1 because it has been well-proven in providing participation model and facilitating each decision maker to express her individual preferences under multi-criteria constraints (e.g. MCDA). We also employ GDM 3 because in most cases of public decision making, the supra decision maker (SDM), as available in GDM 3, actually exists. SDM acts as an arbiter or leader, formally responsible for recommending a decision which balances all stakeholder perspectives [8]. The role of leader is required in participation decision

style because she provides encouragement and resources to other members [1]. However, approach GDM 3 has some weaknesses related to SDM’s role that tends to cause the irrationality and inconsistencies. To deal with this, we utilize trust model to construct agreement among the group in order to seek and manage SDM. We will expand the discussion about MCDA and trust in section 3.
2.3 Success of Public Participation Process
The success of public participation can be viewed from two different viewpoints: outcome and process [6]. Some people may evaluate the public participation only with respect to the outcome of the process. The criteria for the outcome include better accepted decisions, consensus, education, and improved quality of decisions (e.g. English et al. 1993 cited in [14]). The process also has an effect to the success. It has been noted that a fair procedure make people react less negatively to unfair outcome and that fair outcome could make people think more positively about the process [14].
Tuler and Webler [31] studied the opinions of participants concerning a good process. They found seven normative principles, i.e.:
1. Access to the process. 2. Power to influence process and outcomes. 3. Structural characteristics to promote constructive
interactions. 4. Facilitation of constructive personal behaviors. 5. Access to information. 6. Adequate analysis. 7. Enabling of social conditions necessary for future
processes.
In order to achieve success of public participation, we only focus on process aspect. We argue that the success of public participation processes will in turn determine the success of its outcome as well. We make use the principles which mentioned above as a foundation to build our framework and model.
3. Methodology Overview
3.1 MCDA
Commonly used decision-support tool that has been applied in public issues is MCDA (multi-criteria analysis), as discussed in previous section 2.1. MCDA facilitates the use of both, qualitative as well as quantitative measurement scales, which makes it possible to address multidisciplinary problems (e.g. involving consequences on the environment and/or public health issues) [28]. MCDA also structures and facilitates stakeholders's involvement in the decision processes, which has been shown to increase the quality of decisions ([4] [23] [24]

[25] [28]). For further surveys of MCDA applications, see Hamalainen [11].
Although MCDA methods differ in their details, they are often deployed by adopting rather similar decision support processes. Salo and Hamalainen [28] mention MCDA methods, i.e.: 1. Clarification of the decision context and the
identification of group members. In this phase, it is necessary to clarify what the decision is really about, how the group members are identified and engaged, and in what role they will participate in the process. 2. Explication of decision objectives. The relevant decision objectives are elaborated and transformed into corresponding evaluation: (1) criteria C = {ci, i = 1,..., n}: aspects on which the alternatives are assessed; and (2) associated measurement scales with the help of which the attainment of these objectives can be assessed. 3. Generation of decision criteria and alternatives. A sufficiently representative and manageable set of alternatives, A = {ai, i = 1,..., m}: actions which can possibly solve the problem, is generated considering how the decision objectives could be achieved through alternative courses of action. 4. Elicitation of preferences. Here, the group members are engaged, where subjective preference statements are requested. The preferences include: (1) how important the different evaluation criteria are relative to each other, and (2) how much value the group members associate with the alternatives’ performance levels on criterion-specific measurement scales. The measurement scale is represented by weights W = {wi, i = 1,..., n}: assessment of the relative importance of the criteria. 5. Evaluation of decision alternatives. All criteria and alternatives are measured with regard to every decision criterion using a related measurement scale, i.e.: (1) Criteria evaluation vi: (ai, ci)  R: assessment of the alternative on a criterion; and (2) Alternative evaluation v: (ai, C, W)  R: global assessment of the alternatives. 6. Synthesis and communication of decision recommendations. Here, a careful examination of the resulting recommendations is assessed. This phase is in conjunction with the learning process of MCDA analysis and may suggest a re-specification of alternatives or even objectives. It also may be appropriate to repeat some of the above phases.
MCDA is employed to represent the participatory approach under multi-criteria and multi-decision maker constraints, as it facilitates GDM 1 characteristics. We agree with [28] that MCDA provides a sound

methodology for promoting a good decision-making process. Despite its benefit, we argue that MCDA should be attached with other mechanisms to cope with individual’s limitations in making decisions. As a consequence, we construct trust mechanism and integrate it within MCDA method.
3.2 Trust in Decision Making

Trust is a complex concept from sociological and psychological studies which has recently been attracting research from many fields, such as: computer science, cognitive sciences, sociology, economics, and psychology ([19] [33] [35]). Related to computer science, trust has been used in various fields, e.g. information filtering and collecting strategy ([18] [19] [33]), security mechanism ([5] [30]), and recommender system ([34] [35] [37]).
McKnight et al. [22] define trust toward an e-commerce system as an individual’s belief in an agent’s competence, benevolence, and integrity. According to [22] definition, a competence-belief refers to an individual believing that the trustee has the ability, skills, and expertise to perform effectively in specific domains; a benevolence-belief refers to an individual believing that the trustee cares about her and acts in her interests; and integrity-belief means that individual believes that the trustee adheres to a set of principles (e.g., honesty and promise-keeping) that she finds acceptable.

Fig. 1 A community cooperating in a world environment [36]
The model we propose here reflects on how individuals in a community cooperating with each other, as illustrates in figure 1. We implement trust as a means to serve and cooperate among individuals in a community. Competence requirements are represented by trust value among individuals (agents) thus the community rewards them with reputation. Reputation represents as social performance of individual in the community. As a return, the system (world environment) compensates different task and role in the community which related to individual’s trust level, such as: supra decision maker, advisors, and other participants.

Komiak and Benbasat [16] decompose the concept of trust into cognitive and emotional trust, hence when an intelligent agent (e.g. recommender systems) becomes personalized, adoption by customers is not only based solely on cognitive factors but also on emotional. Therefore, they conceptualize trust as a combination of cognitive and emotional trust, based on the assumption that trust decision tend to involve both reasoning and feeling.
Whitworth [36] discusses how social interaction in daily life can be implemented in computing and called this as socio-technical systems. The socio-technical systems based on community normative exchanges emerge from Human Computer Interaction (HCI) systems to face problems in a community (e.g. mistrust, unfairness, and injustice). Figure 1 below shows that society bears the physical consequences of its social acts, as productivity outcomes, which then reflect to its individual members [36]. We apply trust model because trust exists in human society interaction, hence we argue that trust among intelligent agent can deploy better participation process in decision making.

4. Proposed Framework and Model
4.1 Participatory DM Framework and Model
The close involvement of group members within group decision making will be particularly crucial in our framework. It employs MCDA methods using trust as a foundation of cooperation and participation among agents in providing synthesis and communication of decision processes. Hence it promotes constructive interactions and positive personal behavior, as principles of good process mentioned in section 2.3 above. Figure 2 below presents the proposed framework of participatory public decision making.
The framework consists of three main processes, i.e.: 1. Agenda setting process. This process mainly contains of clarification of the decision context, i.e.: problem and objective definition, criteria and alternatives exploration, and identification of participants. The participants can take part in different roles, for instance, as decision makers, sources of expertise, or representatives of their respective stakeholder groups. Each role is identified by each individual trust level. Member who has the highest trust level and trust value

respectively chosen as the supra decision maker. Trust value and level are identified by our proposed trust model, which will be discusses later in section 4.2. 2. Knowledge sharing and education process. This process involves iterative learning process by providing advice taking service. A decision maker can find and ask advisors using trust and reputation mechanisms, in order to improve her decision’s quality. This process also aim to inform participants about the why and how decision is made from other participants’ (e.g. experts) perspectives. 3. Group decision making process. This process includes evaluation of decision criteria and alternatives. All alternatives are measured with regard to every decision criterion using a related measurement scale. These evaluations based on subjective judgments by participants themselves. This process also supports participants’ decisions iteration and refinement in order to reach consensus, facilitating by supra decision maker role.

3. Control and feedback. This flow is very important to identify whether the current decisions have fulfilled the specification requirements or not.
The framework can be extended to more detailed decision making model, as presented in figure 3.

Fig. 3 Schematic illustration of participatory decision making model

Fig. 2 Participatory decision making framework
As the process moves from one to another, there is a synthesis and communication flow. In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat some of the above processes using the flows. The flows are described as follows:
1. Sharing and recommendation. This flow supports both agenda setting process and knowledge sharing and education process. It may suggest a respecification of alternatives or even objectives.
2. Consensus and understanding. This flow delivers common understanding among participants based on some agreement rules.

The decision making model in figure 3 is compatible with the previous framework, which accommodates the framework’s processes, as follows:
1. The agenda setting process covers some activities, i.e.: problem clarification, objective definition, participants identification (e.g. decision makers and supra decision maker).
2. The knowledge sharing and education process involves opinion sharing, information exchange, and advice taking among participants. This process includes some decisions on, i.e.: criteria and weight measurement, alternatives exploration, individual preferences. Participants as decision makers are able to ask advisor(s) provided by our proposed trust model, so then they can decide and possibly do some refinement on their decisions.
3. The group decision making process consists of evaluation and aggregation of individual’s decision. This process is supervised by supra decision maker role. During this process, consensus achievement should be feasible in order to gather the final decision.
4.2 Trust Model
There is no universal agreement on the definition of trust and reputation since it depends on its research context and objectives. In this paper, we use the following working definitions [32]:

IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 2, March 2011

Trust – believe in another entity’s capabilities, honesty and reliability to make judgment and decision
based on its own direct interaction between truster and trustee. Truster is an entity who believe another and trustee is an entity who has been put into a trust for a truster. This belief is interpreted in trust value.
Reputation – believe in another entity’s capabilities, honesty and reliability based on recommendations and direct trust value received from others. The reputation is interpreted in trust level.
Trust in this model is integrated with MCDA methods and used as participation means, whereas participants build sharing and understanding through trust and reputation mechanisms. We modify the properties of a trust relationship from our previous trust model proposed in [32] and apply in our decision making model, i.e.:
1. It is always between exactly two agents: truster and trustee.
2. It is always non-symmetrical: if agent A trusts agent B, it does not mean that B also trusts A.
3. It is conditionally transitive: if agent A trusts agent B and agent B trusts agent C, then A also trusts C with condition that B as recommender to C based on C’s reputation.
4. It is contextual: each trust value only valid for each category.
5. It is reflexive: each agent must have confidence upon its own system before it starts to calculate another agent’s trust value.
6. It is dynamic: trust and reputation relationship increase or decrease with further experience (direct interaction). It also decays with time.

reputation mechanism can be used (step 4a). If for example the truster has confidence in trustee’s reputation, the truster and trustee can have direct interaction (step 5 b), otherwise the truster can find out other trustees (step 4b). 3. Based on direct interaction result, the truster can evaluate the interaction process and give trust value toward her trustee (step 6 and 7). Trust value then can be computed and updated in Trust References Database (TRDB) (step 8 and 9). Trust value gained is checked upon trust level threshold ε (step 10). If trust value > ε for a specific trust level then trust level in UIDB should be renewed as an addition to trust value update itself (step 11). 4. Trust value as a result of recommendation (recommender trust value) also can be updated in TRDB (step 12).

We present the proposed trust model as in figure 4. Mechanism in trust model (figure 4) is divided into (1) trust mechanism and, (2) reputation mechanism, which works as follow [32]: 1. User as a truster finds a few expert decision makers
recommended by the system (based on their trust level and expertise category) (step 1). A trustee is chosen based on trust level saved in User Identity Database (UIDB). Information provided in UIDB is: user ID, trust value, trust level, and expertise category. 2. User as a truster decides whether a trustee is trustworthy or not (step 2). If the truster decide not to believe the trustee, then she can select another trustee candidate (step 3 a). If the truster decide to believe trustee’s capability in providing guidance and judgment then the truster and trustee can have direct interaction (step 5 a). However if the truster has a doubt regarding candidate trustee’s capability then the truster can search other trustees (step 3 b), and

Fig. 4 Proposed Trust Model
In order to provide knowledge sharing and learning process to our previous framework, we establish three main strategies in our trust model, i.e.: 1. Trustworthiness path building. The path between
truster and trustee is built by interaction between truster and trustee, with or without recommenders’ supports. The pseudocodes of algorithm are described below.

Trust level can be increased or decreased by trust value after reaching a defined trust threshold (ε). For example, a trustee can increase her trust level from 2 to 3, by having many direct interactions with others and result in increasing trust value, so then her trust value ≥ ε for trust level 3. Trust level for each participant represents several applicable roles within decision support systems, as presented in table 2.

Trust level is updated when trust value (tv) > trust level threshold (ε). The value is called as reputation trust value (rtv) or simply as trust value (tv) which summed from direct trust value and recommender trust value. Trust value of the trustee candidate could be computed with the collected information using equation (1):
tvp(T) = tv(R1)/4 x tl(R1)/4 x.. x tl (Rn)/4 x rtv(T) (1)
where: tv p (T) = Trust value of Trustee T tv (Ri) = Recommender Trust Value in a return path (includes first recommender and

5. The Example
In this section, we present an illustration of how a participatory public decision support system works within our proposed framework and model. We take a participatory budgeting (PB) case in a municipality. Participatory budgeting is a public decision making process which directly involves local people in making decisions on the spending and priorities for a defined public budget. Figure 5 illustrates several participants involved in a decision support systems related to PB case which is implemented within our proposed framework and model.

We identify eight participants in the system, for instance: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. Participant E acts as a new member in the system with trust level = 1, hence she has to be verified further regarding her identity to be involved in participation process. However, E still can access the information by reading some common news regarding the public decision making event. Participants D, A, B, C, F, G, H having minimum trust level (tl) = 2 can contribute in participation process (i.e. agenda setting and education processes). Participants A, B, C, F, G, H having minimum trust level (tl) = 3 can engage in every process of our framework and mainly participate in group decision making process.

as mentioned in our previous trust algorithm. This set up is very important so then we can avoid any endless hop and enforce any participant to learn and serve others, not only as a recommender but also as a trustee (also called as an advisor). If any trustee still doubts her own preferences, she can ask for supra decision maker’s assistance and advice. Here, the learning process is extended and provided by supra decision maker role.
In this case, G set up maximum hop = 3, counted from the first node (truster) and the last node (trustee). G also define minimum trustee’s trust level = 3 in a specific category (e.g. public health). Suppose that G finds his trusted source, namely: C and F, which then forms two trustworthiness paths. Let say that F can provide the answer to G, therefore F does not have to pass the query from G to another trusted source. It then develops the first path (GF). On the other path, C does not know the answer (recent hop = 1) so then C passes the query to another trusted source, i.e. B (recent hop = 2). Unfortunately, B does not know either thus he passes the query to A (recent hop = 3). Having maximum hop = 3, A has no choice but to answer G’s query. In this path, C and B act as recommender while A acts as a trustee; thus it develops the second path as GCBA. If for some cases, a trustee (e.g. participant A) needs further assistance to provide advices, she can ask for supra decision maker’s (e.g. participant H) guidance.

Fig. 5 Participants identification in the proposed model
Suppose that the system selects only five decision makers, i.e., N = {A, B, C, F, G}. A supra decision maker (SDM) role is chosen among participants A, B, C, F, G, H who has minimum trust level (tl) = 4 and highest trust value compare to others, in a specific category (e.g. in public health category). The system then, for instance, chooses participant H as SDM. Each decision maker, i.e., N = {A, B, C, F, G} will evaluate each alternative in A = {A1, A2, A3} with respect to three criteria C = {C1, C2, C3}. Suppose that one of the decision makers (e.g. participant G) has limited knowledge in prior to make any judgment regarding his preferences A1, where v: (A1, C, W). Let say that alternative A1 is related to budget allocation for public health improvement. Trust model is then utilized to assist participant G for deciding his individual preferences in related category. Hence, the model should provide a successful advice-taking mechanism as well as learning process between participants.

Since the system gets more than one trustee candidates (i.e. participant F and A), it has to find the highest trust value among trustee candidates. Our trust computation algorithm, using equation (1), then calculates the total value for each path (path 1: GF) and (path 2: GCBA). For example, in path 1, G trusts F with trust value (tv=2) whereas F has trust level (tl=3). Hence, trust value computation for path 1 is: tv(F) = ¾ x 2 = 1.5. In path 2, let say that G trust C with trust value (tv) = 4 and C has tl = 3. C give a recommender trust value to B (tv) = 3 and B has trust level (tl) = 4; and finally B recommends A with trust value (tv) = 4 and A has trust level (tl) = 3. Therefore trust value A for this path (path 2: GCBA) is: tv(A) = 4/4 x ¾ x ¾ x 4/4 x 4 = 1.68. Here, tv(A) > tv(F); consequently the system will choose A as G’s trustee. As a result of this, tv(A) and tv(F) will get updated, e.g.: new tv(A) = old tv (A) + 1.68 and new tv(F) = old tv (F) + 1.5. Participant F also gets some trust value rises even though she does not selected as a trustee. As trustee’s trust value increase and achieve minimum trust level threshold (ε), it will improve her trust level in a specific category as well.

In order to assure that G will get any advice from other participants, we have to set up maximum hop in each path,

In the above example, A and F gain more trust value from others by serving advice to others. Other participants also

can improve their trust value as well as their trust level, by actively participating in the system. For example, participant D who does not involve in the decision making process also can increase their trust values, by engaged in opinion sharing or learning process (e.g. training and education); thus she can increase her trust value and trust level providing by recommender trust value from others.
6. Conclusions
In this paper, we presented the framework and model of participatory public decision making, by integrating multicriteria methods and trust model. We believe that a participatory public decision making should support three processes (i.e. agenda setting, knowledge sharing and education, and group decision making). Moreover, each process should be supported with synthesis and communication flow in order to achieve the objective related to the problem.
The example shows that the proposed framework and model supports extensive access to information and process, thus it supports adequate resources and analysis to decisions, and in turn is likely to contribute to enhanced decision quality. The attainment of such quality is facilitated by structural and transparent mechanisms which encourage participants to share their opinion and knowledge by learning from others. In addition to this, involvement of all stakeholders with help of supra decision maker’s role will ensure that the results of the decision model are fully understood in relation to the inputs.
Our next step will be focused on web-based decision support systems building, using our proposed framework guidelines, as our prototype. Also in the future, we will attempt to apply our prototype in the real community to demonstrate that decision’s quality in public sector can be improved by implementing our framework and model. As an addition to our effort, we plan to extend our model by adding consensus achievement mechanism within participatory public decision making.

Abstract
Conversion from another language to native language is highly demanding due to increasing the usage of web based application. Firstly, the respective sentence of a native language is converted to Universal Networking Language (UNL) expressions and then UNL expressions can be converted to any native language. UNL system is developed for most of the languages already but a very little effort has been made to convert Bangla language to UNL expressions. In this paper we have described our work to convert Bangla Sentence into UNL Expression. To do this we have described UNL, Bangla grammar, the rules that we have designed for converting Bangla sentence into UNL expression. Finally, we have applied our rules in a Bangla sentence and demonstrated the conversion.

1. Introduction
The Universal Networking Language (UNL), which is a formal language for symbolizing the sense of natural language sentences, is a specification for the exchange of information. Currently, the UNL includes 16 languages [1], which are the six official languages of the United Nations (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish), in addition to the ten other widely spoken languages (German, Hindi, Italian, Indonesian, Japanese, Latvian, Mongol, Portuguese, Swahili and Thai). In the last few years, machine translation techniques have been applied to web environments. The growing amount of available multilingual information on the Internet and the Internet

users has led to a justifiable interest on this area. Hundreds of millions of people of almost all levels of education, attitudes and different jobs all over the world use the Internet for different purposes [2], where English is the main language of the Internet. But English is not understandable for most of the people. Henceforth, Interlingua translation programs are needed to develop. The main goal of the UNL system, which allows users to visualize websites in their native languages, is to provide a common representation for accessing Internet of multilingual websites by the majority of the people over the world. For this common representation, lexical knowledge is a critical issue in natural language processing systems, where the development of large-scale lexica with specific formats capable of being used by distinguished applications, in particular to multilingual systems, has been given special focus. Our goal is to include Bangla in this system with less effort. So far very little effort has been made to convert Bangla language to UNL expressions. We have been working on this topic from the last 3 years. To convert Bangla sentences into UNL expression we needed to go through the Bangla grammar and UNL very rigorously. Simultaneously we have communicated with the UNL center of the UNDL Foundation. They have made two agreements with us: i) Agreement for entering UNLs and ii) UDS agreement, and provided us user name and password to access their resources and utilities. Then we have started converting Bangla sentences into UNL expression successfully. Although we have already worked on Bangla Simple and Compound sentences, but for better understanding of the most of the readers of this

paper we have taken a simple affirmative Bangla sentence, “আিম ভাত খাi”, pronounced as ‘Aami vat khai’, meaning of which is ‘I eat rice’ and shown how it can be converted into UNL expression. But it is not limited to this sentence only. This simple example can convert many more sentences of this type. The organization of this paper is as follow: In Section 2 we describe the Research Methodology, Section 3 has the detail about UNL, Section 4 describes Bangla grammar in detail. In Section 5 and 6 we discuss about the dictionary entries and rules respectively, which we have designed and developed to convert Bangla sentence, Section 7 explains how the rules, developed by us, will be applied to convert, Section 8 shows the result of our work. Finally, Section 9 draws conclusions with some remarks on future works.
2. Research Methodology
For converting Bangla sentence to UNL expressions firstly, we have gone through Universal Networking Language (UNL) [3, 4] where we have learnt about UNL expression, Relations, Attributes, Universal Words, UNL Knowledge Base, Knowledge Representation in UNL, Logical Expression in UNL and UNL systems. All these are key factors for preparing Bangla word dictionary, enconversion and deconversion rules in order to convert a natural language sentence (here Bangla sentence) into UNL expressions. Secondly, we have rigorously gone through the Bangla grammar [5, 6, 7, 8], Verb and roots (Vowel ended and Consonant Ended) [5, 6], Morphological Analysis [7], Primary suffixes [5, 6], Cases and their inflexions [6], construction of Bangla sentence [8] based on semantic structure. Using above references we extort ideas about Bangla grammar for morphological and semantic analysis in order to prepare Bangla word dictionary (for root, root word suffix etc), morphological rules and enconversion rules in the format of UNL provided by the UNL center of the UNDL Foundation.
3. UNL System – in a nutshell
Although there is an immense proliferation of information through Internet, it is not accessible to vast multitude of people across nations as most of the resources are in English. To overcome this problem, United Nations launched Universal Networking Language project [10] in 1996. The result of the project is universal networking language (UNL), a language neutral specification, and a universal parser specification [11]. The goal is to eliminate the massive task of translation between two languages and reduce language to language translation to a one time

conversion to UNL. The UNL [12] has been introduced as a digital meta-language for describing, summarizing, refining, storing and disseminating information in a machine independent and human language neutral form. This meta-language focuses to express meanings in standardized way. We think that a comprehensive description of UNL specification is necessary though it is available in UNL website. The meaning of native language sentence is expressed in UNL system as a hypergraph composed of nodes connected by semantic relations. Nodes or Universal Words (UWs) are words loaned from English and disambiguated by their positioning in a knowledge base (KB) [10] of conceptual hierarchies. Function words, such as determiners and auxiliaries are represented as attributes to UWs or nodes to provide additional information. The core structure of UNL is based on the following elements:
1. Universal Words 2. Attribute Labels 3. Relation
Labels 4. UNL Expression 5. Hypergraph 6.
Knowledge Base
3.1. Universal Words (UW)
Universal Words are words that constitute the vocabulary of UNL. A UW is not only a unit of the UNL syntactically and semantically for expressing a concept, but also a basic element for constructing a UNL expression of a sentence or a compound concept. Such a UW is represented as a node in a hypergraph. There are two classes of UWs from the viewpoint in the composition:
 labels defined to express unit concepts and called “UWs” (Universal Words)
 a compound structure of a set of binary relations grouped together and called “Compound UWs”.
A UW is a English-language word followed by a list of constraints. The following is the syntax of description of UWs in context free grammar (CFG):
<UW> ::= <headword> [<constraint list>] <headword> ::= <character>… <constraint list> ::= “(“ <constraint> [ “,” <constraint>]… “)” <constraint> ::= <relation label> { “>” | “<” } <UW> [<constraint list>] | <relation label> { “>” | “<” } <UW> [<constraint list>] [ { “>” | “<” } <UW> [<constraint list>] ] … <relation label> ::= “agt” | and” | “aoj” | “obj” | “icl” | ...
3.2. Attributes
The attributes [4] represent the grammatical properties of the words. Attributes of UWs are used to describe subjectivity of sentences. They show what is said from the speaker’s point of view: how the speaker views what is said. This includes phenomena technically called speech, acts, propositional attitudes, truth values, etc. Conceptual

66

relations and UWs are used to describe objectivity of sentences. Attributed of UWs enrich this description with more information about how the speaker views these states-of-affairs and his attitudes toward them. For example, the corresponding UW of play is “play(icl>do)”. If the word “play” is in the past form in the sentence an attribute @past is tagged with “play(icl>do)”. If it is the main word in the sentence then @entry will be tagged such as “play(icl>do),@entry,@past”.

3.3. Relational Labels

The relation [4] between UWs is binary that have different
labels according to the different roles they play. A relation
label is represented as strings of three characters or less.
There are many factors to be considered in choosing an
inventory of relations. The following is an example of
relation defined according to the above principles.
Relation: agt (agent) Agt defines a thing that initiates an action. agt (do, thing) agt (action, thing ) Syntax: agt[“:”<CompoundUW-ID>]“(“ {<UW1>|“:”<Compound UW-ID>} “,” {<UW2>|”:”<Compound UW-ID>} “)” An agent is defined as the relation between: UW1 - do, and UW2 - a thing Here UW2 initiates UW1, or UW2 is thought of as having a direct role in making UW1 happen

Examples of “agt” relation

John breaks agt(break(agt>thing,obj>thing),

…

John(icl>person))

Mary broke the window

agt(break(icl>do).@entry.@past, Mary)

Some relations in UNL are as follows:

3.4. UNL Expression
The UNL expresses information or knowledge in the form of semantic network. UNL semantic network is made up of a set of binary relations, each binary relation is composed of a relation and two UWs that hold the relation. A binary relation of UNL is expressed in the following format:[4] <relation> ( <uw1>, <uw2> ) In <relation>, one of the relations defined in the UNL specifications is described. In <uw1> and <uw2>; the two UWs that hold the relation given at <relation> are described.
3.5. Hypergraph
The UNL expression is a hyper semantic network. That is, each node of the graph, <uw1> and <uw2> of a binary relation, can be replaced with a semantic network. Such a node consists of a semantic network of a UNL expression and is called a “scope”. A scope can be connected with other UWs or scopes. The UNL expressions of in a scope is distinguished from others by assigning an ID to the <relations> of the set of binary relations that belong to the scope. The general description format of binary relations for a hyper-node of UNL is the following:[4] <relation> :<scope-id> ( <node1>, <node2> ) Where,  <scope-id> is the ID for distinguishing a scope.
<scope-id> is not necessary to specify when a binary relation does not belong to any scope.  <node1> and <node2> can be a UW or a <scope node>.
A <scope node> is given in the format of “:<scope-id>”.
3.6. Knowledge Base

aoj (thing with attribute) bas ( standard (basis) of comparison) cag (co-agent) con (condition) dur (duration) equ (equivalent) gol (goal: final state) iof (an instance of) mod (modification) plc (place) pur (purpose or objective) rsn (reason) src (source: initial state) tim (time)

The UNL Knowledge Base (KB) [10] gives possible binary relations between UWs. The knowledge base is a set of knowledge base entries. The format of knowledge base entries is as follows.
<Knowledge Base entry>::= <Binary relations> "=" <degree of certainty><Binary Relation> ::= <Relation Label> "("<UW1>","<UW2>")"<degree of certainty> ::= "0" | "1" | ... | "255"
When the degree of certainty is "0", it means the relation between two UWs is false. When the degree of certainty is more than "1", it means the relation between two UWs is true, and the bigger the number is, the more the credibility is.

4. Bangla Grammar
After studying and understanding the UNL concept we have realized that we need to develop the following in order to convert Bangla sentence into UNL expression.  A Bangla word dictionary  Morphological and Semantic rules
To develop the above we have rigorously gone through the following part of Bangla grammar so far.  Root, Vowel and Consonant ended  Primary Suffixes (Krit Prottoy and Verbal Inflexions)  Cases and their inflexions  Verbs In the next chapter we have discussed about Bangla verb which covers the other topics also.
4.1 Verb
Diversity of verbs in Bangla is very significant [5, 6]. Morphological analysis is applied to verbs to get roots and suffixes. Many different words (nouns, adjectives or verbs) can be derived from a single root. For example, the verb ‘কিরেতিছ’ (koritechi), is analyzed into root ‘কর’ (kor) and suffix ‘iেতিছ’ (itechi). In Bangla there is a significant number of roots. A good number of suffixes are combined with these roots to form verbs or nouns or adjectives [5, 6, 7]. The suffixes that are combined with roots are divided two groups: [6]
4.1.1 Verbal Inflexions (িঞয়া িবভিk, pronounce as ‘kria bivokti’): The suffixes that are combined with roots to form verbs are known as Verbal Inflexions (VIs). For instance, the VIs ‘i’(e), ‘েবন’ (ben), ‘েc’ (chhe) and ‘িcেলন’ (chhilen) make verbs যাi(jai), যােবন (jaben), ‘যােc’ (jachhe) and ‘যািcেলন’ (jachhilen) respectively combining with verb root ‘যা’(ja) means ‘go’ in English
4.1.2 Primary Suffix (কৃ ৎ pতয্য়, pronounce as ‘krit prottoy’): These types of suffixes are combined with roots to form nouns or adjectives. For example

In this paper, we have focused on first type of suffixes named Verbal Inflexions that are combined with roots to form verbs.
Verb = Root + Verbal Inflexion
4.1.3 Roles of Root and Verbal Inflexion in the formation and meaning of a verb: A root contains the core meaning, which relates with the action or state of the verb, whereas verbal inflexion (VI) defines the formation of the verb and reflects person, tense (in case of finite verb) and other properties. For instance, the root ‘খা’ (kha) means ‘eat’ indicates the action of the verb ‘খাiেতিছ’ (khaitechi), to get food through mouth where as the VI ‘iেতিছ’ (itechi) indicates the person (1st person) and tense (present continuous) of that verb. In UNL, person of an inflexion plays role in morphological and syntactic analyses of the verb but has no importance in semantic analysis of the verbs. That means it does not add or change any semantic relation and attribute. On the other hand, tense of an inflexion plays a significant role in semantic field. It adds or changes semantic attributes in the UNL expressions but does not affect on the relation.
4.1.4 Variations of roots: Some roots change their forms when they combine with some specific VIs to make verbs. For example, the root ‘যা’ (ja) means ‘go’ remains unchanged when it combines with VI ‘iেতিছ’ (itechi) to make verb, ‘যাiেতিছ’ (jaitechi) but the same root changes it’s form to ‘িগ’ (gi), ‘েগ’ (ge) and ‘েয’ (je) when it combines with VIs ‘য়ািছলাম’(achilam) to make verb ‘িগয়ািছলাম’ (giachilam), ‘লাম’ (lam) to make verb ‘েগলাম’ (gelam) and ‘তাম’ (tam) to make verb ‘েযতাম’ (jetam) respectively. All the variations of a root appear in the lexicon at different entities, though they all contain same UW but in case of grammatical attributes we use ALT, ALT1 and ALT2 with verb roots ‘িগ’ (gi), ‘েগ’ (ge) and ‘েয’ (je) as they are the first, second and third alternatives of verb root ‘যা’ (ja) etc. and rest of the attributes will be the same for all variations shown in table 1, table 2 and table 3.

চl(chol) + an (onto) = চলn(cholonto)

5. Proposed Dictionary Entries

Root Primary Suffix Adjective
ধর(dhor) + আ (aa) = ধরা(dhora) Root Primary Suffix Noun

After having a good understanding on UNL and Bangla grammar discussed in section 3 and 4 respectively we have started developing Templates for dictionary entries of Bangla Root and Verbal Inflexion.

5.1. Dictionary Entries
We know that Dictionary Entries are made using HW (Head Word), UW (Universal Word) and GA (Grammatical Attributes) [10]. HW indicates the native language word; here, Bangla word in this case, UW is

corresponding to the concept from Knowledge Base and GAs are grammatical behaviors of that particular word in that particular language. For example, if we consider Bangla word “পািখ” (pakhi) means ‘bird’ then its dictionary entry is: [পািখ]{} “bird(icl>vertebrate>thing)” (N, ANI, FLY) <B, 0, 0>

where, “পািখ” is Bangla HW, “bird(icl>vertebrate>thing)” is UW from Knowledge Base and N denotes noun, ANI for animate thing and FLY for flying thing respectively are the grammatical attributes of the above word.
5.1.1 Template for Bangla Verb Root: The template that we are designing here for Bangla roots is depicted bellow: [HW] {} “UW (icl/iof…>concept1>concept2, REL1>.., REL2>…,” (ROOT, VEND/CEND [,ALT/ALT1/ALT2..] VEGn/CEGn, #REL1, #REL2,.. <FLG, FRE, PRI> where, HW← Head Word (Bangla Word; in this case it is Bangla root); UW← Universal Word (English word from knowledge base); icl/iof/… means inclusion/instance of …to represent the concept of universal word REL1/REL2.., indicates the related relations regarding the corresponding word. ROOT ← It is an attribute for Bangla roots. This attribute is immutable for all Bangla roots. CEND and VEND are the attributes for consonant ended and vowel ended roots respectively as every root is ended either with consonant or vowel; VEGn ← means attribute for the group number of vowel ended roots CEGn ← means attribute for the group number of consonant ended roots ALT, ALT1, ALT2 etc. are the attributes for the first, second and third alternatives of the vowel or consonant ended roots respectively. If the root is default, then no alternative is used. #REF1, #REF2 etc. are the possible corresponding relations regarding the root word Here, attributes say, ROOT, CEND/VEND are fixed for all Bangla roots whereas ALT or ALT1 etc. does not necessary for all roots, they are used only for alternative roots. In the following examples we are constructing the dictionary entries for some sample Bangla roots using our designed template: [যা]{}“go(icl>move>do, plf>place, plt>place, agt>thing)” (ROOT, VEND, VEG3, #PLF, #PLT, #AGT)<B, 0, 0> [িগ]{}“go(icl>move>do, plf>place, plt>place, agt>thing)” (ROOT, VEND, ALT, VEG3, #PLF, #PLT, #AGT) <B,0,0> [খা]{}“eat(icl>consume>do,agt>living_thing, ins>thing, obj>concrete_thing, plf>thing, tim>abstract_thing)” (ROOT, VEND, VEG1, #PLF, #PLT, #AGT)<B, 0, 0> In the examples above, for first two entries the relation plf (place from) indicates from where agent go/goes, plt (place to) means to where go/goes, agt(agent) for who go/goes and attribute ALT indicates that root “িগ “(gi) is

the first alternative of root “যা “(ja) discussed in table 1. Attributes #PLF, #PLT and #AGT indicate that relations plf, plt and agt can be made with roots “িগ “(gi) and “যা “(ja). Similarly, other entries can be developed according to the format above.
5.1.2 Template for Verbal Inflexion: In the previous section we designed a template for Bangla verb roots. However the template for Verbal Inflexion is very similar to that of Bangla verb roots. One thing is verbal inflexions do not have any universal word and they have only grammatical attributes and differ each other with attributes they use. [HW]{} “” (VI, V, Aperson [,ALT/ALT1,ALT2...], GEN/RES/NEG, Atense, SD/CH, VEGn/CEGn/^VEGn/ ^CEGn.) <FLG, FRE, PRI> HW← Head Word (Verbal Inflexion of Bangla Verb Root); UW← Universal Word (In case of Verbal Inflexion, UW is null); VI← is an attribute of Verbal Inflexion, V← Verb, since Verbal Inflexions form verb when it is added with Bangla verb root as Suffixes so we keep the ‘V’ as an attribute. Aperson← Attribute person, this is an important attribute because verb varies according to Bangla Person. ALT/ALT1/ALT2 ← Attributes for alternative roots. These attributes are used as attributes of verbal inflexions when they are combined with respective verb roots. GEN/RES/NEG← Attributes for verbal inflexions when they are combined with verb roots to form general (GEN), respective (RES) and neglect (NEG) verbs in respect to person. They are used as attributes with the VIs that are combined with verb roots to form verb for second and third persons Atense ← Attribute Tense, This is also an important attribute because verb varies according to Bangla Tense. SD/CH← Attribute for types of languages. SD for ‘shadhu’, which is literature language and CH for ‘cholti’, which is conversation language. They are used as attributes with the VIs as they form SD or CH types of verbs. VEGn/CEGn/^VEGn/^CEGn← Attributes indicate for vowel ended group number or consonant ended group number of not for vowel or consonant ended group. They are used as attributes of VIs as they are combined with respective groups or not. Like verb roots some attributes like VI, V are fixed for all Verbal Inflexioni but Aperson can be either attributes ‘P1’(for first person), ‘P2’ (for second person) or ‘P3’ (for third person) and Atense can be any tense such as attributes ‘PRS’ (for Present Indefinite), ‘PRG’ (progress for Present continuous) CMPL (complete for perfect tense) etc. If the tense is past continuous then two attributes are used consecutively such as attribute ‘PST’ (for past) and ‘PRG’ (for continuous) and for future tense FUT is used.

Some examples of dictionary entries of Verbal Inflexions according to the proposed template are given below: [েয়িছলাম] “ ”{}(VI,P1,PST, PER,ALT,CH,VEG1,VEG9) [িcলাম] “ ”{}(VI,P1,PST,PRG,CH) [িব] “ ”{}(VI,P2,NEG,FUT,CH) [েcন] “ ”{}(VI,P2,RES,PRT, PRG,CH) Here, VI, ‘েয়িছলাম’ can be combined with first alternative roots( as ALT is used to define attribute) with verb roots of vowel ended group 1 or vowel ended group 1.1 for past perfect tense ( attribute PST for past and CMPL for perfect) to create the verbs of conversation language (CH attribute for conversation language) for first person (attribute is P1). Similarly, attributes for other dictionary entries are defined.

6. Proposed Morphological and Semantic
Rules
If we consider a sentence say, “আিম ভাত খাi” (pronounce as aami vaat khai.) meaning, “I eat rice.” for conversion process. Assuming that all the words and morphemes of the given sentence are in the dictionary as follows:
[আিম]{}"i(icl>person)"(PRON,HPRON,1P,SG,SUBJ)<B,1,1> [ভাত]{}"rice(icl>food)"(N)<B,0,0> [খা]{}"eat(icl>consume>do,agt>living_thing,obj>concrete_thing )"(ROOT,VEND,#AGT,#OBJ,VEG1)<B,0,2> [i]{}""(VI,VEND,1P,PRS)<B,0,0>

where, attributes PRON denotes pronoun, HPRON for human pronoun, 1P for first person, SG for singular number, SUB for subject, N for noun, ROOT for verb root, VEND for vowel ended root, #AGT for agent (means agent relation can be made with root ‘খা’ (kha) , #OBJ for object (like as agent relation), VEG1 means the root is fall in the vowel ended group 1, VI is the attribute for the verbal inflexion that can combine with root to make verb while PRS means present tense. EnCo can input either a string or a list of words for a sentence of a native language. A list of morphemes or words of a sentence must be enclosed by [<<] and [>>] [4]. When the sentence is taken into EnCo, it places the sentence head (<<) in the LAW, sentence texts or morphemes or words in the RAW and the sentence tail (>>) in the RCW shown in figure 1.

Figure 1: Initial state of the Analysis Windows and the node list

After insertion of the input file with our given sentence the following rules, which we have developed, will be applied step by step to complete the conversion process of the sentence to UNL expressions. Rule 1:
R{SHEAD:::}{PRON,SUBJ:::}P10;
Rule 2:
DR{SUBJ,^blk:blk::}{BLK:::}P10;
Rule 3:
R{PRON,SUBJ:::}{N:::}P10;
Rule 4:

Rule 10:
R{SHEAD:::}{VERB,^&@entry:+&@entry::}P1
0;
Rule 11:
R{VERB:::}{STAIL:::}P10;
We have developed the above rules by following the UNL specifications described in the next two sub-sections.
6.1. Morphological rules Morphological analysis is found to be centered on analysis and generation of word forms. It deals with the internal structure of words and how words can be formed [13]. It is applied to identify the actual meaning of the words [14] identifying the Prefixes and Suffixes. Morphological study comes here to help with rules for analyzing the structure and formation of the Bangla verbs. Rules for morphological analysis of verbs are used to combine the roots with their corresponding inflexions to complete the meaning of the verbs. An Enconversion Rule (morphological/semantic) is composed of Conditions for the nodes placed on the Analysis Windows and Condition Windows, and Actions and/or Operations for the nodes placed on the Analysis Windows. Such enconversion rules describe the kind of actions and/or operations that should be carried out for all phenomena of a language, and under what conditions. EnConverter will find the most suitable rule every time, and create a partial syntactic tree and/or UNL expression. A set of UNL expressions of a sentence will finally be completed after having applied a set of all the necessary rules. Out of 15 different types of rules [main] 2 rules are used for morphological analysis. One is left composition rule (<) and another is right composition rule (>)

6.1.1. Left Composition (+): The basic type of this group is “+”, this type of rule is used basically to create a syntactic tree with the two nodes on the Analysis Windows [4.] By applying this type of rule, the two headwords of the left and right nodes are combined into a composite node, the original left and right nodes are replaced with the composite node in the Node-list, and the sub-syntactic tree and attributes of the left node are inherited. If the operator "@" appears in the <ACTION> field of the rule for the left node, the attributes of the right node are also inherited.
Application of this rule implies the deletion of the original two nodes from the Node-list and the insertion of the new composite node into the Node-list. The position of the new composite node is on the right Analysis Window.
6.1.2. Right Composition (-): The basic type of this group is “-“, this type of rule is used basically to create a syntactic tree with the two nodes on the Analysis Windows. By applying this type of rule, the two headwords of the left and right nodes are combined into a composite node, the original left and right nodes are replaced with the composite node in the Node-list, and the sub-syntactic tree and attributes of the right node are inherited. If the operator "@" appears in the <ACTION> field of the rule for the right node, the attributes of the left node are also inherited [4].
Application of this rule implies the deletion of the original two nodes from the Node-list and the insertion of the new composite node into the Node-list. The position of the new composite node is on the right Analysis Window.
6.2. Semantic Rules Semantic rules are used for creating semantic relations. Semantic relation describes the relations between the words in the sentence. They are used to form semantic network of the UNL [4]. Two types of rules are used for this relation.
6.2.1. Left Modification Rule (<): This type of rule creates a Syntactic Tree and a Semantic Relation for the two nodes on the Analysis Windows. The right node becomes the modifier of the left node. This rule deletes the right node from the Node-list, while the left node becomes the head of this partial syntactic tree and remains in the Nodelist. It creates a semantic relation, according to the designation of the relation in the <RELATION> field, with the node where the relation is described in the <RELATION> field as the to-node and the partner node as the from-node of the semantic relation. It adds the semantic relation to the list of semantic relations of the left node, and outputs it in the result of UNL expressions when the enconversion is completed.

If the operator "@" appears in the <ACTION> field of the rule for the left node, the attributes of the right node are also inherited. After applying this type of rule, the left node moves to the right Analysis Window.
6.2.2. Right Modification Rule (>): This type of rule creates a Syntactic Tree and a Semantic Relation for the two nodes on the Analysis Windows. The left node becomes the modifier of the right node. This rule deletes the left node from the Node-list, while the right node becomes the head of this partial syntactic tree and remains in the Node-list. It creates a semantic relation, according to the designation of the relation in the <RELATION> field; with the node where the relation is described in the <RELATION> field as the to-node and the partner node as the from-node of the semantic relation. It adds the semantic relation to the list of semantic relations of the right node, and outputs it in the result of UNL expressions when the enconversion is completed.
If the operator "@" appears in the <ACTION> field of the rule for the right node, the attributes of the left node are also inherited.
After applying this type of rule, the right node remains in the right Analysis Window.
7. Conversion of Bangla sentence into UNL
applying the proposed rules
Let us consider the sentence, “আিম ভাত খাi” pronounce as “aami vat kha”i meaning, “I eat rice.” for conversion process and apply the rules given in section 6.
Rule 1 is Right Shift rule that describes that when sentence head is in the Left Analysis Window (LAW) and word ‘আিম’ (aami) is in the Right Analysis Window (RAW) then AWs will be shifted to right after rule application. In this situation, the Enco will retrieve the word, ‘আিম’ (aami) from the Word Dictionary file and remains in the LAW and ‘ভাত খাi’ (vat khai) will be in the RAW. Rule 2 is Right Node Deletion rule, it deletes the right node which is blank space between ‘আিম’ (aami) and ‘খাi’ (vat) and only the noun ‘ভাত’ (vat) will be placed in the RAW while the verb ‘খাi’ (khai) will be placed in the Right Condition Window (RCW). Again right shift rule (rule 3) is applied to shift the windows to right and Right Node Deletion rule (rule 4) is applied to delete the space between ‘ভাত’ (vat) and ‘খাi’ (kaai) so that the word ‘ভাত’ (vat) is retrieved from the Word Dictionary and remains in the LAW and the verb ‘খাi’ (kaai) is divided into root ‘খা’ (kha) which remains

72

in the RAW and verbal inflexion ‘i’ (i) remains in the RCW. Now, again right shift rule (rule 5) is applied to place ‘খা’ (kha) in the LAW and ‘i’ (i) in the RAW to perform the morphological analysis. In this situation, Enco retrieves the dictionary entries of ‘খা’ (kha) and ‘i’ (i) from the word dictionary (input file) and will apply the analysis rule (rule 6) that is if there is a vowel ended root ( in our example, ‘খা’ ) is in the LAW and verbal inflexion ( in our example, ‘i’ ) is in the RAW then after applying the rule the two headwords of the left and right nodes are combined into a composite node to complete the morphological analysis of the verb ‘খাi’ (khai) [section 6.1.1] Rule 7 is attribute changing rule used to rewrites the attributes by deleting attributes VI, VEND, and CEND the for verb ‘খাi’ (khai) that remains in the RAW. Now Enco starts semantic analysis between the words of our sentence by applying semantic rules 8 and 9. Rule 8 is Right Modification Rule (>), indicates that if noun ‘ভাত’ is in the LAW and verb ‘খাi’ is in the RAW then an object relation (obj) is made between them where ‘খাi’ remains in the RAW and ‘ভাত’ is deleted. [section 6.2.2] Now the word ‘আিম’ (aami) comes to the LAW and an agent relation (agt) is made between ‘আিম’ (aami) and ‘খাi’ (khai) by applying rule 9, so that ‘আিম’ (aami) is deleted from the node-list and the verb ‘খাi’ (khai) remains in the RAW which is the main predicate of the sentence. After that right shift rule 10 is applied to shift the windows to right and &@entry attribute is added to the verb as verb ‘খাi’ (khai) is the main word of the sentence. Finally, rule 11 is applied to place the sentence tail (STAIL) on the LAW to complete the conversion process [4]

Abstract
This study firstly presents a review for well known Mobile IP and the recently proposed Host Identity Protocol which inherits the separation of roles of IP addresses in today’s internet architecture. Afterwards, several performance evaluations are presented that performed on the testbed based on infraHIP implementation of the Host Identity Protocol. Performance results have been obtained and analyzed regarding the Base Exchange, throughput, round trip times and mobility events of Host Identity Protocol.

HIP Implementation and Testbed, Mobility
1. Introduction
Wireless devices, cell phones and the internet, along with the development of new technologies in the fields of electronics have managed to provide a catalog of new devices capable of providing multiple services at the same time and allowed the fusion of voice and data networks and their services. The current horizon unveils a new phase in the evolution of communications, the management of mobility in order for a user to keep connectivity to the network, and hence the word, at all times or at least reduce the amount of time wasted by a person while disconnecting from one point and immediately connecting to a new point of attachment to the networks, which may not be a big time, but continuously interrupts and affects the communication, exchange of data and eventually the overall experience of the end user.
Mobile IP was the first formal effort done by the technological groups (IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force) to satisfy the need of mobility among different networks and an overall better experience in this field, some extensions and enhancements have been gradually added to the original architecture such as “fast mobile IP”

and have made the original protocol a more robust and viable solution to the problem. Recently, a new joint effort have been achieved at the Helsinki Institute for Information Technology (HIIT) on a new concept called Host Identity Protocol (HIP) to the problems of separating the IP address from the location of the node using identifiers and thus improving mobility and security in any communications network.
The objective of the study is to perform different tests and evaluations to verify and validate a mobility management platform using one of the current software implementations of HIP (infraHIP: Infrastructure for the Host Identity Protocol), report the results obtained and provide the appropriate feedback of the error and complications encountered, as well as the proposal for improvements in the design of the platform, focused mainly in the management of the handovers of a mobile device.
2. Mobile IP and Fast Mobile IP Anticipation Processes
There are different concepts of mobility, they all depend on the context of discussion, the concept of mobility in telecommunications, especially concerning a node roaming from one network to another, refers to the ability of a node to maintain open communications and a continuous flow of data after having changed the point of attachment from its original network to a new link. The principal elements of a mobile IP infrastructure are the mobile node, the home agent and the foreign agent [1]. In order for a mobile node and the agents using mobile IP to communicate constantly, two main processes have been defined to aid the mobile node in different aspects throughout its mobility events. Those process described below define the discovery of other peers capable of supporting mobile IP, the advertisement of the home and

foreign agents to inform nodes of the service provided by them, and the registration process necessary by any node to quest and register a mobile IP service from an agent.
One of the biggest concerns regarding mobility is the fact that packets and information sent to a mobile node is lost during a mobility event when a node changes its point of attachment to the home link and connects to a foreign link elsewhere, this is due to the mobile node being unreachable during the handover process. The fast handover extensions for mobile IPv4 and IPv6 defined in the IETF RFC 4988 [2] and RFC 4068 [3], describe processes as well as new messages implemented under mobile IP to optimize the handover of a mobile node between home links and foreign links. The original version of mobile IP inherits a reactive approach towards mobility as it was designed for a mobile node to notice a mobility event and inform the home agent link and other peers of the new care-of address only after the node was located in the foreign link. The new approach proposed in the fast mobile IP, aimed to diminish the time taken by a mobile node for the setup of the new care-of address, as well as the agent discovery and association times by searching for the required information of the new link from the home link before the mobility handover event.
The design for the fast mobile IP extension considers a handover of the mobile node from an access router acting as a foreign agent to a new access router that will eventually assume the role of the foreign agent; these two elements are referred to as previous access router (PAR) and new access router (NAR). The extension also considers a previous care-of address (PCoA) and a new care-of address (NcoA) as the addresses of the mobile node prior and after the handover to a NAR. The enhancement of the handover management process in the fast mobile IP extension consists on the mobile node creating a neighborhood access point and subnet map using either the new “Router Solicitation for Proxy Advertisement” (RtSolPr) sent by the mobile node after obtaining a care-of address and registering with the home agent as defined in the original version of mobile IP, or the new “Proxy Router Advertisement” (PrRtAdv) messages sent by the foreign agents. The map created by the mobile node contains the information necessary for the node to select a new point of attachment on the proximity of a handover event, once the next point of attachment is selected and with the information provided by the map, the node may process a new care-of address before the handover event and set up a tunnel to forward temporarily any data sent to it during the handover.
The only difference between a predictive and a reactive handover message flow in fast mobile IP relies on the

actual process of the early handover request by the PAR with the HI message, as in a reactive handover management scenario there is no need to confirm the availability of a NcoA, since the mobile node has processed one before requesting a fast binding update to the PAR and only needs for the PAR to create a tunnel with the NAR and forward any packets received on behalf of the PCoA to the NCoA.
3. Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
The Host Identity Protocol is a recently developed protocol that provides a secure end-to-end mobility and multihoming solution just like Mobile IP. However, the approach taken by HIP consists on the separation of the identifier used currently to define both the identity and the location of a host, the IP address of the host. Instead of relying solely on the IP address of a host (like Mobile IP does), the HIP protocol maintains the location of a host related to the IP address specified in its network layer, but it also defines a new identifier named a Host Identity Tag (HIT) as the identity of a host, this identity (generated by a 128 bits public-private key pair) is to be used in the transport and application layers instead of the currently used IP address. This separation of identity/location, allows to easily map a host to different locations (HIT-> IP1, HIT->IP2, and so on), hence allowing an easy implementation of mobility and multihoming.
The origins of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP) go as back as 1999, when Robert Moskowitz from the ICSA Inc. labs proposed and introduced the first draft of the basic architecture of HIP in the IETF on May 1999 [4]. Since then, a working group lead by Pekka Nikander with the additional support of Ericsson Nomadic Lab, Boeing and HIIT started adjusting the details of the draft and were able to deliver the submission of the specification of the protocol by 2004. Shortly afterwards, the IETF working group for HIP started its functions on June 2004 and up to this present day, the architecture of HIP has been thoroughly test-proofed and refined, providing so many alternatives and possibilities that and even a second working group has been created, the HIP research group of the IRTF, the main work of this group consists on the development of new features for the mobility and multihoming features of HIP as well as the impact on the Internet once HIP is deployed as a standard.

layer client can reach out for a host using the host identity tag (HIT) instead of the current IP address as the host identifier, consequently, the HIP layer will perform the corresponding mapping of the host's identity to its current location and reachable IP address.

responder node with HIP session initiation messages.

Fig. 1 Basic architecture of HIP (Courtesy of [5])
The process starts with a basic exchange registration where an exchange of information is done in order to create an IPSec security association that assures a secure connection between the hosts throughout the HIP session. The following sections describe more into detail the basic registration process as well as the mobility and multihoming features of HIP.
3.2. Base Exchange
Before any HIP session between hosts is established or any information is transferred, a security check and an exchange of credentials needs to be made to guarantee the identity and the willingness of the initiator host to enter and start a HIP conversation with another host. The figure below illustrates the basic exchange process as an exchange of four HIP messages between two hosts. The host willing to initiate a HIP session is called the Initiator and is the node that sends the first HIP message in the basic exchange. This first message is called I1 and as parameters it contains the host identity tag (HIT) of the source node (being the initiator) and the host identity tag of the destination node that is referred as the Responder node.
When a node receives a HIP message with the message type set to I1, it will automatically send back to the initiator node (in an extremely short time T1) a HIP message type R1 that it has previously prefabricated with the HIT of the initiator, the HIT of the responder, DiffieHellman parameters to create the session keys for the security association, the signature to prove the identity of the responder node and most importantly, a puzzle to be solved by the initiator node before in order to continue with the process. The inclusion of a puzzle by the responder node as a cryptographic challenge during the basic exchange registration is done in order to avoid a DoS attack from a bogus node that wishes to saturate a

Fig. 2 Basic exchange process in HIP
A responder node will only dedicate resources to enable a HIP session to a node that properly solves the puzzle (with a level of difficulty defined by the responder node) and replies back with the solution to the challenge in the following I2 message. Once the Initiator has spent a T2 time solving the puzzle challenge, it will send the correct solution in the third HIP message (I2) along with its own Diffie-Hellman parameters for the second security association, the HIT keys and the signature to prove the authenticity of the message.
The last step in the basic exchange process will be for the responder node to confirm the HIP session with a signed R2 message which asides from the source and destination HITs of the message may optionally include the registration information of the initiator node to any services(s) provided by the responder node. Usually this T3 time period is very short as well, leaving most of the percentage time of the basic exchange process to the initiator node. Once both nodes have set their IPSec Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) Security Associations (SAs) and established a HIP session, they will open and transfer the information from the transport and application layers solely through IP Sec ESP Bound End-to-End Mode (BEET) tunnels.
3.3. Mobility and Multihoming
The IETF RFC5206 [6] describes mobility in HIP as the possibility for a node to maintain reachability with all of the other nodes it keeps an open HIP session with, regardless of the possible changes in the point of attachment to a network in the node. This availability of the HIP node is provided b the LOCATOR parameter, which provides a list of all of the possible IP addresses on which a node can be reached at, along with pairing information of the different HIP security association parameters such as the ESP Security Parameter Indexes.
