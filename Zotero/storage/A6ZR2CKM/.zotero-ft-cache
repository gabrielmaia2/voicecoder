Abstract:
Modern compression algorithms are often the result of laborious domain-specific research; industry standards such as MP3, JPEG, and AMR-WB took years to develop and were largely hand-designed. We present a deep neural network model which optimizes all the steps of a wideband speech coding pipeline (compression, quantization, entropy coding, and decompression) end-to-end directly from raw speech data - no manual feature engineering necessary, and it trains in hours. In testing, our DNN-based coder performs on par with the AMR -WB standard at a variety of bitrates (~9kbps up to ~24kbps). It also runs in realtime on a 3.8GhZ Intel CPU.

1. Introduction

The everyday applications of data compression are ubiquitous: streaming live videos and music in realtime across the planet, storing thousands of images and songs on a single tiny thumb drive, and more. In a way, improved compression was what made these innovations possible in the first place, and designing better and more efficient methods of compression could help expand them even further (to developing nations with slower Internet speeds, for example).
