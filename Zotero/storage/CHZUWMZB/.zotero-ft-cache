Introduction

The Internet has burgeoned into a worldwide information superhighway during the past few years and wrought significant changes in the telecommunications arena. This unprecedented growth motivated the development of innovative applications with high bandwidth and low end-to-end delay requirements. One of the applications that thrived is Voice over IP (VoIP). VoIP, also known as IP or Internet telephony, is the technology that enables people to use the Internet as the transmission medium for voice communications. Beginning as a frolic among computer enthusiasts, VoIP has set off a feeding frenzy in both the industrial and scientific communities. Since its inception, huge strides have been made and now VoIP enjoys widespread popularity as an alternative to traditional telephony in homes and enterprises.

VoIP has the potential to revolutionize telephone communications. The trend toward voice communications over the Internet is mainly fuelled by the salient advantages Internet telephony offers. VoIP opens up exciting possibilities for users. In particular, it paved the way for monetary savings. It is cheaper for end-users to make an Internet telephone call than a circuit-switched call since most VoIP providers offer affordable long distance and international calling. Moreover, a significant amount of money can be saved on the monthly phone service considering that IP telephony service is less expensive than the traditional phone service. In addition, VoIP offers service flexibility since there are no dependencies between the application and the underlying network. VoIP users can already enjoy a variety of features, which they previously had to pay for, for free. Some of these features are voicemail, caller ID, call conferencing, call waiting and call forwarding. This kind of users can also enjoy some new features like e-mailed voicemail and the easy management of contacts. Moreover, new services will commence to flourish as the market matures that will break the shackles of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) for voice services. One service that is expected to catch on is voice e-mail. Another key asset of IP telephony is flexibility. A user can move the IP Phone wherever he/she needs and still keep the same phone number. In addition, this technology offers a big step forward in available features and functions and allows end-users to control different media and different types of terminals from their Web browsers. Users will be able to set up conference calls from their homes, check the state of their accounts at any time and so on.

Several compelling reasons also impelled service providers to consider providing voice communications over the Internet. First and foremost, VoIP promises them new revenue sources. Further, new operators can capitalize upon this technology since it gives them an easy and cost-efficient way to compete with incumbent operators by undercutting their pricing regimes, while avoiding the regulatory hindrance to standard voice provision. From an engineering viewpoint, VoIP also holds considerable appeal because it gives carriers the ability to manage a single network that supports both voice and data.

Notwithstanding the aforementioned advantages, several issues must be accounted for while designing a VoIP system. VoIP is sometimes likened to mobile telephony because they both present some clear advantages over voice communications over PSTN. Mobile networks provide mobility and flexibility, whereas VoIP has an edge in cost savings. Moreover, VoIP performance is on a par with the performance of mobile cellular systems. On this account, there are some circumstances where the quality is considered acceptable. However, several strides remain to be made in order for VoIP to match the performance of the well-engineered PSTN. A laudable aim is to provide the same level of quality as PSTN does.

In this paper, rather than glossing over this promising technology, we aim to shed light to all these aspects that have the greatest bearing on voice quality (Fig. 1). We begin our survey with a reference to the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements that VoIP imposes, followed by a description of how certain performance metrics affect speech quality. Remedies are discussed as well. Before elaborating upon the factors that affect the performance of a VoIP system, we also spell out several test methods that have been devised to gage voice quality. Then, a plethora of voice codecs are delineated and their performance disparities are accentuated, along with all the aspects that should be contemplated before opting for a codec. Closely related to the selection of voice codecs are also the issues of silence suppression and voice packetization. Thus, we touch upon them as well. Another issue that receives intense scrutiny in our study is header compression techniques. Header compression techniques are the stepping stone to efficient bandwidth utilization. All the compression schemes that have been proposed thus far are compared against each other in order to come up with the most efficacious one.

Next we turn our attention to signaling protocols. Signaling protocols lay the foundations for high-quality voice communications since they are responsible for establishing and tearing down calls. We describe the salient features of all the well-known protocols with a view to listing their pros and cons. Moreover, we touch on the way Skype works, albeit information about Skype’s signaling protocol is hard to procure. We also cast light to the way VoIP systems interface with PSTN. Next, we lay particular emphasis on an aspect that has often been considered as the downside of VoIP, that is, end-to-end QoS. Development of end-to-end QoS presents numerous challenges and is contingent upon the ability of the underlying network to provide differentiated QoS to various applications and users. Our attention is drawn towards call admission control (CAC) techniques. CAC and QoS are inextricably interwoven. A plurality of CAC techniques can be found in the literature. We describe all the schemes that are geared towards VoIP and some important conclusions are drawn. The next issue that we treat in this survey is security of VoIP networks. It is beyond the realms of possibility that a system will not experience malicious attacks that will aim to impair its performance. Contrary to the PSTN, VoIP systems are exposed to a number of threats. We first analyze the potential threats and then discuss several approaches on how to protect a VoIP network. We also dwell on the impact of security measures on QoS. Last but not least, we conclude this survey with a discussion on the feasibility of providing VoIP over satellite links. Next generation telecommunications systems can be viewed as an ultimate amalgamation of all existing and emerging fixed and mobile systems. In this context, satellite systems will be called to support Internet telephony and we aim to cast light on the main problems that arise in this case.
Section snippets
QoS requirements of voice

Owing to advancement in technology over the years, traditional voice communication over the PSTN is characterized by high quality, often referred to as toll quality. When it comes to VoIP, stringent QoS constraints must be met in order to provide the same level of quality. Three are the main performance indicators that characterize the quality of voice communications over the Internet. The first one is average end-to-end delay, also referred to as one-way delay or mouth-to-ear delay. It is the
Quality assessment

Since the current Internet was not designed to transport voice traffic, an important aspect in VoIP communications is the assessment of voice quality. It is imperative that new voice services undergo a significant amount of testing to evaluate their performance. In this section we outline the test methods that are geared towards the evaluation of VoIP systems.

Testing methods can be classified into subjective and objective tests [7], [11]. Subjective methods rely on the opinion of a panel of
Voice codecs

Since the early days of networking bandwidth has been considered a resource at a premium. Therefore, significant efforts have been drawn towards the minimization of the amount of bandwidth required by specific services in order for the network to be able to serve a greater number of users. In this context, compressing voice signals while keeping the quality perceived by users at acceptable levels represents a daunting challenge. This section is devoted to the methods that either are currently
Voice Activity Detection

The Voice Activity Detection (VAD) technique stops sending data when there is no voice signal. This can normally achieve a 30–35% saving of the bandwidth, and can be implemented either directly into the codec or at the voice concentrator. However, the variety and the varying nature of speech and background noise makes VAD a daunting challenge. Real speech is distorted by background noise, especially in distant-talking situations. Inaccurate detection of the speech periods causes deterioration
Packetization efficiency

Related to the problem of choosing the most appropriate codec is also the question of how much speech can be placed in an IP packet. Voice is loss-tolerant and delay sensitive, therefore voice is carried over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). In addition, since VoIP applications are real-time, the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) runs on top of UDP [55]. On the one hand, sending small packets is inefficient due to the increased header overhead. On the other hand, large packets lead to long
Header compression

As mentioned earlier, in applications such as VoIP the payload of the IP packet is roughly of the same size or even smaller than the headers. Even though these headers are important over the end-to-end path, they serve no significant purpose over just one link. Thus, it is possible to compress them in order to utilize bandwidth more efficiently.

The information carried in each header is necessary for a successful communication of applications over long paths comprising multiple links. This
Signaling protocols

For the establishment of telephone calls over the Internet, a signaling protocol is of paramount importance because it enables network components to communicate with each other, set up and tear down calls. In the case of IP telephony, a call can be defined as the multimedia session between two or more participants, while signaling associated with a call is referred to as a connection. The role of a signaling protocol can be broken down into four functions:

    –

    User location: The caller first has to

QoS via call admission control

The advent of IP networks has given service providers tremendous opportunity to offer both traditional services and a range of new services. However, providers need to find incentives for users to use and pay for these services. In this context, QoS represents an issue of utmost importance. VoIP poses substantial challenges, the most important one being perhaps resource management. As befits a subject of such importance, Call Admission Control (CAC) techniques for VoIP have been the subject of
Security

While most of the technical hurdles appear to have been overcome, security still constitutes a major concern. Security hinges on allowing only authorized users to make calls as well as ensuring that the content of a conversation is not eavesdropped. VoIP brought a new set of protocols that expose the network to the whim of technically savvy users. Several groups have pointed out several design and implementation flaws in VoIP’s building blocks. In the following section we provide a cursory
VoIP over satellite links

So far we have surveyed many different areas of VoIP systems. Although the presentation was made in a general context, usually when one refers to VoIP, terrestrial systems spring to mind. This section aims to shed light to the potential of providing VoIP over satellite links. Fourth generation (4G) systems can be viewed as an ultimate amalgamation of existing and wireless fixed and mobile systems. Satellite systems can be instrumental in this future network infrastructure beyond any doubt,
Conclusions and future perspectives

Users and service providers are lured by the voices that praise countless benefits and new business opportunities, but can VoIP compete with traditional telephony systems? Albeit there is no clear-cut answer to this trite question, it is indisputable that Internet telephony is endowed with some outstanding characteristics and has the potential to revolutionize telephone communications. VoIP nowadays enjoys the fruits of labors during the past few years and it can be considered a mature

    CO-CAC: A new approach to Call Admission Control for VoIP in 5G/WiFi UAV-based relay networks
    2023, Computer Communications
    Citation Excerpt :

    Similarly, modern cellular networks have also been migrating to VoIP since UMTS (3G). In comparison with traditional voice calls, ensuring QoS in VoIP networks is challenging due to the best effort service of IP and the strict bounds in network delay, packet loss and jitter required by VoIP [41–43]. Thus, telco operators used dedicated bandwidth and traffic prioritization in their well-provisioned IP transport networks to guarantee an adequate QoS level.

    We have simulated CO-CAC in a 50 m   50 m scenario with four UAVs providing VoIP service to up to 200 ground users with IEEE 802.11ac WiFi terminals. Our results show that without CAC, the number of calls that did not meet a minimum quality level during the simulation was 10% and 90%, for 50 and 200 users, respectively. However, when CO-CAC was in place, all calls achieved minimum quality for up to 90 users without rejecting any call. For 200 users, only 25% of call attempts were rejected by the admission control scheme. These results were narrowly worse when the ground users moved randomly in the scenario.
