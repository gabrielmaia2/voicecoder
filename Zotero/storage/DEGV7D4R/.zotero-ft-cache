Compression Of Wideband Sound For Multimedia
Application
Adrian Rominski, Zygmunt Ciota'

Absfrocr - Two methods of sound compression: MPEG and Ogg-

Vorbis have been discussed and compared. The objective eritcria

has been uscd during test procedure. Mired hardwarc-software

approach can improve the speed and also the quality of the

compression. Audible noise cancellation in high quality speceh

processing has been also pmcnted. Furthermore, speech coding

system has to have real-time capabilities, so the hsrdwarr-

software co-design permits to achicve low cost and high-speed

performances.

INTRODUCTTON

GPL (General Public License) made up by Richard Stallman is completely new idea of soflware and intellectual property distribution. GPL guarantees free of charge possibility of coping, using and access to the source code of the program. Idea of free software witten by a little more experienced users and given to whole community had been ignored long time until Linux started up as the professional and competitive product to the most powerful operational systems which cost a lot of work and money and are created by the most powerful firms ofthe world.
W e can observe two strategies of big firms being active in this new reality: combating against this new trend with all means, while the second strategy is a trial of cooperation and using this new experience in own products, vide Sun corporation.
The second part of the article deals with the hardware implementation of algorithms for sound processing. The earlier mentioned GPL licensed solution are also very attractive in this context.
11. ORBIS-OGG AS THE NEW GPL COMPRESSlON
FORMAT

An oppressive license policy in time of CD-writers, printers, Internet and other technical possibilities ofcoping and spreading any kind of media but also in time of huge resources of created programs, multimedia contents, seems to be a little bit out of date.
An equivalent of Linux system in audio compression formats is vorbis-ogg format [l]. It is based on GPL and is available absolutely for free. Now state of the project could be described as Release Candidate 3, it means that offered codecs, also in source code version, for the most popular operational systems, machines and programs (LinuxAJNIX, Windows, Macintosh, BeOS, Winamp and other players plug-ins) are

fully functional and ready to use, moreover there is no discovered errors in the program operation.
Users tests proved that quality of sound at the same bitrate is better than for MPEG audio layer 3 (famous MP3) and comparable to lately created MP3pr0, but without any fees also for coders, coding and using in hardware players at any bitrate [2]. Of course, the popularity of 0% is still less than widely spread MP3, but Internet query showed up, that it is the second most used format for compression after MP3, but more often used than strongly promoted Microsoft Windows Media Audio 8.
Not only music is a place for audio compression. Sound tracks in films are very promiscuous; tandem DivX - Ogg seems to work now only in 2 channels, but multi-channel surround sound is coming and it will be strong alternative for Dolby Digital, DTS and MPEG. Also other branches of electronic entertainment started to use the new format. Many computer games were released with sound in Vorbis-Ogg, one of them Schinn were awarded with Seal Of Excellence Adrenaline Vault. Ogg format was not created in the vain and utilizes experiences of yet created formats. Some main features, characterized good, modem audio codec were established:
Effective compression based on MDCT, but with opportunity of using other methods
Variable Bitrate (VBR), which accommodates bitrate to signal characteristics, but with possibility to obtain restricted bitrate in order to utilize transmission channels with fixed
bitrate for a signal.
Multi-channel (2 and much more than 2 channels) feature with possibility of using correlation between channels in compression process
GPL license Ogg is predefined for using in streamable digital media as Internet radio, Voice Over IF' telephony, communication between players in computer games, etc. Tags system useful for description of files with predefined
tags and user definable tags
111. SOME OTHER FEATURES WHlCH WILL BE
USEFUL IN THE FUTURE
Today we stand in front of a big problem, growing rapidly in multimedia, but also other information and contents. These problems, mostly derives from extraordinary amount of multimedia information. One ofthe Peer-To-Peer file exchange client offers hundreds of terabytes compressed music, it equivalent of human life duration. In that situation is obvious,

that one man cannot listen all these files, so it is necessary to index and describe all pieces of the information.. Contemporary tag system works now, but one day may not be enough, even set o f headers will overcome limits of lmmun perception. One of the solutions could be splitting data base between users using different contents and then let them interchsngc information. Maybe, some inforniation should be also incrementally deleted to make room for new things (how to decide which?). Another challenge are new methods of coding which will allow algorithmic coding of sound, like sound synthesis with type of voice choosing, coding of niusic with vocal with newer equivalent of MIDI fomiat. Xiphomorphous intend to create also moving picture coding (Tarkin project), it could be very interesting, specially with new restrictive licensing policy of MPEG 4, when many firms tries to find an alternative.
Iv. COMPARISON TEST
We have made some test based on objective (not the best in case of subjective lossless formats, but always objective) criteria. Because Vorbis codec is VRR (Variable Bitrate), the same option was used in MPEG layer-3 codec. The coding was made with Vorbis RC3 encoder and LAME MPEG layer-3 encoder considered as one with the best quality, mp3 encoder. The codecs were set up to obtain the same average bitrate of about 128 kbit's, coding was made from source file of CDaudio quality (44100Az,16 bitlsample, stereo). Tne set of parameters for tnp3 coding is shown in Figure 1, whilc the parameter for Vorbis codec is shown in Figure 2. Because Vorbis is made as VRR from the beginning, the average bitrate is derived from the quality factor, but there is a method to set lower and upper limit for the bitrate. The first criteria (very often used) is bandwidth of encoded sound, 3 seconds o f white noise was used to examine the codecs, as it was sliown in Figure 3. Vorbis encoder performs all the bandwidths, while mp3 encoder (see Figure 4) has a threshold at about 12 kHz. It is worth to say that subjectively high frequency sound are weakly audible.

Channel separation was very good in both cases, so this test is not worth of publishing. The third test has been performed as pre- and post-echo test. Encoders often doesn't work properly leavingladding some artifacts before and after original sound. We used a sound consisted of 1 sec. of silence, 3 seconds ofwhite noise and then again 1 second o f silence. As it is shown in Figure 5 the sound has delay, because the noise should finished at 4th second, and then there is a long period ofpost-echo fading. about lOms in comparison with 2ms of Ogg's post-echo (Figure 6 ) .

case of Ogg Vorhis. Pie-echo is similar as post-echo for both

codecs.

This 3 tests revealed an advantage in the objective

criteria, but it should he mentioned that it is not a "full tnitli"

about codecs. The most important i a people opinion based on

subjective criteria but sometimes also connected with customs,

prejudices and economic criteria. One of the important criteria

ihat could be taken into consideration is encoder speed.

Because Vorbis is rather fresh and under development, so there

was no possibility to optimize it, like LAME, which uses

MMX and has strongly optimized code. One of the way of

optimization could he through the hardware acceleration. For

example, such oflen repeated operations, like MDCT transform

are predisposed to realize them in hardware form (see Figure 7

and 8).

HIGH QUAIITY VOICE PROCESSING

The latest development of multimedia systems demands new methods of speech processing like effective coding, recognition and synthesis [3,4,5].The vocal communication between computer and man has nowadays a lot of gaps, because language is very essential evidence of humanity. As a consequence, it is necessary to improve the transformation methods of speech signal for obtaining more efficient transmission procedures and also for an enhancement of intelligibility. New digital signal processing permits to apply a lot of effcient algorithms (using dctcrministic and probabilistic approaches) for speech processing.

The sampling technique permits to obtain high quality speech under the condition, that noise spectrum has to bc located under the three first formants (resonances) of the synthesized voice, according to Figure 6 . The proper shape o f noise spectrum can be achieved by using adaptive filters.

widely tipplied in different applications like full-duplex transmissions of telephone lines for acoustic echo cancellation, blind source separation, channel equalizers and noise cancellation. Since modem adaptive filters have to be suitable for real time applications, it is necessary to build appropriate fast algorithms. Such adaptive algorithms should be a compromise between high convergence, low steady-state error
and fast tracking properties. The FIR filters are the most frequently used in adaptive
systems. The application of the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithms and its modification to the control of FIR filter
