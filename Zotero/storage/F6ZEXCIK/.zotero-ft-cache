Abstract
Over the years, the aim of error-free continuous speech recognition has remained controversial.Environmental robustness has acquired widespread acceptance as one of the key topics of research in the voice recognition field in recent years. Several methods have been investigated. Window framing, speech feature extractions, feature filtering techniques, and other algorithms have all been examined and shown to improve recognition accuracy. One of the neuron connectivity strategies for artificial intelligence applications is to distinguish between sound signals in form of voice and unvoiced. The device first applies fixed weights to these audios before providing output for each format and high speed. Communication through Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) in modern-age speech is attracting many researchers. Voice Activity Detector (VAD) is a technique of distinguishing the articulated portion of speech and the silence component in the original voice signal. In many applications such as speech recognition, voice compression systems, mobile communication, this approach plays an important role for obtaining better speech quality and reducing bandwidth complexity.

Voice Activity Detection, Signal Processing, Artificial Neural Network
1 Introduction
VAD avoids needless coding or transmission of silence packets in VoIP applications and use huge amount of bandwidth due fewer computations. For designing a perfect VAD, we require self-sufficient background for noise which is a most difficult part as speech often gets corrupted due to background noise and other ecological reasons. Therefore, VAD is used to improve the speech detection robustness in raucous atmosphere. For stationary backdrop noise, averaging the spectrum of raucous signal and computationally is approximated. However, for an active/non stationary situation noise spectrum becomes a quite complicated as noise diverges quickly over time and continuous updating is necessary.
2VAD Trends and Applications
The use of voice recognition has spread well beyond customer service phone lines. It can be found in our cell phones and on our computers, and it is employed in a wide range of different businesses as well. The applications for voice recognition appear to be virtually limitless. When it comes to voice activity detection, the following are some of the most popular trends and applications.

(i)Voice-activated mobile payments are becoming increasingly popular
Do you ever become worried about how you're going to pay for things in the future? What if you could make payments using your voice instead of cash or your credit card? Would you believe it if I told you that it would be possible one day to pay with your voice instead of cash or a credit card? It's possible that day will arrive very soon! There are companies working on voice recognition for money transactions right now, and they are based in the United States. When you shop from your smartphone or computer, this method is convenient because you won't have to seek for your wallet as you would otherwise.
Using voice recognition, you can make payments in the following ways: Prior to completing an online purchase, this technology allows you to speak a one-time password rather of typing in your password or personal identification number (PIN). Consider captchas and other onetime passwords that help to improve internet security, but this is stated aloud instead of on a screen. It is considerably superior to using the same password every time since the random nature of the password assures that someone will not be able to overhear you reciting your password and then make purchases in your name on your behalf. Mobile payments that use voice recognition are on the verge of becoming widely accepted and popular.
(ii)Artificial Intelligence Assistants which can detect your specific voice
The majority of us are now familiar with Siri, Alexa, and other typical artificial intelligence (AI) assistants who aid us with daily chores at home and at the office [23][24]. You may use these artificial intelligence assistants to assist you in getting directions while driving, to Google something or start a music playlist without having to pick up your device, or even to switch the lights on in your home. These assistants normally reply to any voice that triggers them, and they do not respond differently depending on who is speaking to the assistant.
However, there are currently technologies that allow artificial intelligence systems to recognise and understand the identities of their users [25] [26]. Using this technology, it is feasible, for example, to have it activate just when a specific person's voice is heard. It has already been implemented with iPhones in the last few years, according to the company. The Siri feature on your iPhone can be configured so that it will only execute tasks or answer queries when you speak into the device. Unauthorized users will be far less likely to mess with your devices, data, and belongings if your AI assistant is only activated by your specific voice, as seen in the following example [27] [28]. Anyone who is not permitted to use the assistant will simply be unable to activate it. In the near future, this technique will almost definitely be used to a variety of different uses [29][30].
(iii)Voice Identification for Security Purposes
The majority of people have a large number of online accounts that require protection, and some of these online accounts such as online banking applications, pose significant security threats. Now that internet banking has become so widespread, it is critical that strong identification procedures are put in place to ensure that only the account owner has access to important information on the account. The use of voice detection is one of the more recent ways of user identification. A speech authentication factor, similar to artificial intelligence assistants that know your distinctive voice, acts as a one-of-a-kind 'password' that unlocks
[11608]

secured accounts only when your voice is utilised[31][32][33]. Anyone else will be unable to access the account due to the fact that their voice is different from mine.
Because multi-factor systems, which combine a variety of security elements, may now be used, this provides exceptionally high levels of security. Take, for example, the scenario in which you need to scan your fingerprint and pronounce your password loudly in your own distinct voice in order to gain access to your online banking service. That is significantly more secure than the use of a standard password in most cases. In addition to speech recognition, there are systems that use facial recognition as well as voice recognition.
(iv)Voice detection in Forensics and Criminal Identification
Using voice recognition detection technology to assist in the identification of criminals is one of the more startling advances in the field of VAD. It is now possible to use audio recordings of a crime suspect as key evidence if they have been made by a third party. There is now a collaboration between AGNITIO and Morpho (Safran) that is bringing Voice ID technology into the forensics business. This device has made it possible for voice biometrics technology to be utilised all over the world (in conjunction with fingerprints and other methods) to assist in the identification of persons and the verification of their background history.
3.Artificial Intelligence
Since the development of computers or machines, their ability to execute a wide range of jobs has increased tremendously in both quantity and quality. As humans progressed in their understanding of computer systems, they increased their power in terms of their diverse working areas, growing speed, and shrinking size as a function of time. Artificial Intelligence is a discipline of computer science that is dedicated to the development of computers or machines that are as intelligent as human beings.
When a machine can mimic the human brain and execute tasks and make decisions in the same way that the human brain can, this is referred to as artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is the term used to describe the machine's intelligence. Artificial intelligence is an integrated area that encompasses a wide range of disciplines such as computer science, mathematics, neurology, and other related fields. In general, there are three steps in the development of artificial intelligence.
To begin, there will be learning, wherein necessary data will be taken from a source, and this data will be used to assist in the formulation of rules. Second, reasoning in which formed rules are thrown in reaction to a given input and, after mapping all of the rules, a definite conclusion is generated in response to the supplied inputs. Thirdly, self-correction [16], in which the system corrects itself using heuristic data.
4. Neural Network
The neural network is basically a parallel computing device that, just like human brain, is capable of performing multiple computations and making decisions. The biological nervous system of humans serves as the primary inspiration for the neural network[34][35][36]. It is a

collection of various processing elements that are interconnected with one another, as illustrated in Figure 1. The examples are used to train the neural network.
The training process prepares the neural network for a specific task or application. Weights are adjusted during the training phase in order to reduce error. These changes are made between neurons. Subtracting the observed value from the required value yields the error. An input layer, an output layer and one or more hidden layers are the three main layers of a neural network. [37] [38][39]
â¢ Input layer: The input layer of a neural network is made up of numerous input neurons that are present in a given network [23][24][25]. The neural network's initial data is provided by the input layer. In other words, the input layer accepts data in the various formats specified by the programmer or user.
â¢ Hidden Layer: The hidden layer is the second layer of the neural network. This layer sits between the network's input and output layers. A lot of hidden neurons constitute the hidden layer. These neurons are in charge of all computations and calculations to determine the features of the user-supplied input to the input layer. A neural network may have one or more hidden layers.

Figure 1. Artificial neural network
â¢ Output Layer: A neural network's output layer is its last layer. It consists of one or more output neurons. The user's input is transformed and computed using the neural network's hidden layer. The output layer communicates the network's final outcome or result. The input is acquired by the artificial neural network, which then computes the weighted total of the provided inputs and bias[26][27][28]. In Table 1, it is simple to distinguish between the most famous machine learning applications and their source types, as well as between some related applications, as illustrated by the examples.

5. Problem Definition In this manuscript, proposed an improved model for unsupervised Voice Activity Detection. An improved model begins from analysing the optimal window overlapping size to feature extractions with the help of not only one or two merges VAD features extractions methods rather we have used four features extraction methods so that our new model gives better results. After these steps, we introduced a new technique as the classification of speech and non-speech i.e. hybridization model of two classifiers i.e. Artificial Neural Network and K-means clustering methods as shown in figure 2 which further enhance the signal to noise ratio in the unsupervised speech signal.

Figure 2: Proposed Model of VAD
And SNR ratio is also improved by using hybrid model of ANN and K-means classifications. As voice segment recognised by both classifiers will further considered for voiced labelled. So chances of missing voice segments will be less in this case.
Conclusion The development of a speech recognition model made use of artificial neural networks. The goal was to employ a genetic algorithm to develop a learning neural network that could learn new things. This technology has been applied to the device identifying numbers, resulting in the establishment of a

voice command recognition system that recognises commands spoken by the user. The development of these features is based on the fact that recorded conversation analysis has already shown features that can be used to lay the groundwork for automatic detection of speech parameters. Predicting accuracy was usually higher when forecasting was done using current data set knowledge.
