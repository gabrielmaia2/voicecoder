Abstract:
Neural networks have sophisticated abilities for processing and filtering signals. In particular, Elman and Zipser demonstrated that the back- propagation network develops significant feature representations which may be useful for both segmenting and recognizing speech. Such networks might find applications in speech compression andor normalization. The networks apparent potential for speech applications justifies further exploration, and this paper describes our work in progress.
