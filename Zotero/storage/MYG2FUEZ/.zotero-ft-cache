Abstract:
We consider the problem of voice cloning, which is desirable in many film-related industries, and developed a new modification of the AutoVC state-of-the-art model in the task of voice conversion. We studied the replacement of recurrent modules with convolutional layers while maintaining the quality of the original model. The result of our work showed the speed improvement on longer voice tracks and faster training with the tiniest deterioration in sound quality, as evidenced by the reconstitution loss and Mel-cepstral distortion.

I. Introduction

Deep learning models have become useful in many fields of applied machine learning. In our studies, we showed the advances of deep learning approaches in various computer science fields, for e.g., in depth estimation deep learning helps to reconstruct depth from various input sources in an end-to-end manner [1]–[7]; in graph machine learning deep neural networks aggregate information from similar nodes [8]-[11]; in deep reinforcement learning agents extract meaningful state representations to propagate reward into action policies or model human behavior in video-games [12]–[20]; in graph recommender systems meaningful features are extracted and fused from attribute and structural information [21]–[29].
