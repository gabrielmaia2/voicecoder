Abstract:
In this paper a novel approach for implementing isolated speech recognition is studied. While most of the literature on speech recognition (SR) is based on hidden Markov model (HMM), the present system is implemented by Radial Basis Function type neural network. The two phases of training and testing in a Radial Basis Function type neural network has been described. All of classifiers use Linear Predictive Cepstral Coefficients. It is found that the performance of Radial Basis Function type neural networks is superior to the other classifier Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks. The promising results obtained through this design show that this new neural networks approach can compete with the traditional speech recognition approaches. Promising results are obtained both in the training and testing phases due to the exploitation of discriminative information with neural networks. It is found that RBF trains and tests faster than MLP.

I. INTRODUCTION

Automatic speech recognition has been an active research topic for more than five decades. With the advent of digital computing and signal processing, the problem of speech recognition was clearly posed and thoroughly studied. These developments were complemented with an increased awareness of the advantages of conversational systems. The range of the possible applications is wide and includes: voice-controlled appliances, fully featured speech-to-text software, automation of operator-assisted services, and voice recognition aids for the handicapped.
