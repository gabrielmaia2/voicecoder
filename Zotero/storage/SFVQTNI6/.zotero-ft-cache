Abstract:
This paper describes a voice message summarizing method for retrieving specific voice messages from a large number of voice messages on voice services, such as voice mail and voice bulletin boards. Voice browsing facilities are tools intended to allow users to handle voice messages as easily and conveniently as browsing books. After surveying methods for voice browsing, the author proposes a new voice message summarizing method that is based on the important part being spoken slowly and having a higher proportion of unvoiced parts. The effectiveness of this method was demonstrated using actual voices from radio programs.< >
