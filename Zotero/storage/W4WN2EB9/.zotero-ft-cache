Abstract

Apart from the existing technology on image compression represented by series of JPEG, MPEG and H.26x standards, new technology such as neural networks and genetic algorithms are being developed to explore the future of image coding. Successful applications of neural networks to vector quantization have now become well established, and other aspects of neural network involvement in this area are stepping up to play significant roles in assisting with those traditional technologies. This paper presents an extensive survey on the development of neural networks for image compression which covers three categories: direct image compression by neural networks; neural network implementation of existing techniques, and neural network based technology which provide improvement over traditional algorithms.
Introduction

Image compression is a key technology in the development of various multimedia computer services and telecommunication applications such as teleconferencing, digital broadcast codec and video technology, etc. At present, the main core of image compression technology consists of three important processing stages: pixel transforms, quantization and entropy coding. In addition to these key techniques, new ideas are constantly appearing across different disciplines and new research fronts. As a model to simulate the learning function of human brains, neural networks have enjoyed widespread applications in telecommunication and computer science. Recent publications show a substantial increase in neural networks for image compression and coding. Together with the popular multimedia applications and related products, what role are the well-developed neural networks going to play in this special era where information processing and communication is in great demand? Although there is no sign of significant work on neural networks that can take over the existing technology, research on neural networks of image compression are still making steady advances. This could have a tremendous impact upon the development of new technologies and algorithms in this subject area.

This paper comprises five sections. Section 2discusses those neural networks which are directly developed for image compression. Section 3contributes to neural network implementation of those conventional image compression algorithms. In Section 4, indirect neural network developments which are mainly designed to assist with those conventional algorithms and provide further improvement are discussed. Finally, Section 5gives conclusions and summary for present research work and other possibilities of future research directions.

Basic back-propagation neural network

Back-propagation is one of the neural networks which are directly applied to image compression coding 9, 17, 47, 48, 57. The neural network structure can be illustrated as in Fig. 1. Three layers, one input layer, one output layer and one hidden layer, are designed. The input layer and output layer are fully connected to the hidden layer. Compression is achieved by designing the value of K , the number of neurones at the hidden layer, less than that of neurones at both input and the output
Neural network development of existing technology

In this section, we show that the existing conventional image compression technology can be developed right into various learning algorithms to build up neural networks for image compression. This will be a significant development in the sense that various existing image compression algorithms can actually be implemented by simply one neural network architecture empowered with different learning algorithms. Hence, the powerful parallel computing and learning capability with neural networks can
Neural network based image compression

In this section, we present two image compression systems which are developed firmly based on neural networks. This illustrates how neural networks may play important roles in assisting with new technology development in the image compression area.
Conclusions

In this paper, we have discussed various up-to-date image compression neural networks which are classified into three different categories according to the nature of their applications and design. These include direct development of neural learning algorithms for image compression, neural network implementation of traditional image compression algorithms, and indirect applications of neural networks to assist with those existing image compression techniques.
