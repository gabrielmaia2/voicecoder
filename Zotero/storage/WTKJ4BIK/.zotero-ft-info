Title:          A Bottleneck Auto-Encoder for F0 Transformations on Speech and Singing Voice
Subject:        In this publication, we present a deep learning-based method to transform the f0 in speech and singing voice recordings. f0 transformation is performed by training an auto-encoder on the voice signal's mel-spectrogram and conditioning the auto-encoder on the f0. Inspired by AutoVC/F0, we apply an information bottleneck to it to disentangle the f0 from its latent code. The resulting model successfully applies the desired f0 to the input mel-spectrograms and adapts the speaker identity when necessary, e.g., if the requested f0 falls out of the range of the source speaker/singer. Using the mean f0 error in the transformed mel-spectrograms, we define a disentanglement measure and perform a study over the required bottleneck size. The study reveals that to remove the f0 from the auto-encoder's latent code, the bottleneck size should be smaller than four for singing and smaller than nine for speech. Through a perceptive test, we compare the audio quality of the proposed auto-encoder to f0 transformations obtained with a classical vocoder. The perceptive test confirms that the audio quality is better for the auto-encoder than for the classical vocoder. Finally, a visual analysis of the latent code for the two-dimensional case is carried out. We observe that the auto-encoder encodes phonemes as repeated discontinuous temporal gestures within the latent code. -9pt
