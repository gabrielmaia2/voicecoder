Abstract

Voice transformation (VT) aims to change one or more aspects of a speech signal while preserving linguistic information. A subset of VT, Voice conversion (VC) specifically aims to change a source speaker’s speech in such a way that the generated output is perceived as a sentence uttered by a target speaker. Despite many years of research, VC systems still exhibit deficiencies in accurately mimicking a target speaker spectrally and prosodically, and simultaneously maintaining high speech quality. In this work we provide an overview of real-world applications, extensively study existing systems proposed in the literature, and discuss remaining challenges.

    Citation Excerpt :

    Hence, this is the reason why the used SE and VC methods cannot provide suitable performance for moderate dysarthria patients. In addition, the voices of the source and target speakers must be paired and aligned during the SE and VC conversion training procedure [55]. However, a defect in the consonant pronunciation of dysarthric speakers can easily produce errors in the corpus alignment [4].
